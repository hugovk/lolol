<p>I move a pace--<span class="lol">lol</span>, such! and such!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I have foretold it to you. 28:8.</p>

<p>So I shook her and <span class="lol">lol</span>! she was dead.</p>

<p>He who shall think, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! I am slain!</p>

<p>It is the <span class="lol">lol</span> here! and the <span class="lol">lol</span> there!</p>

<p>and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he trembled and became a man.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here I give thee Abigail! MATHIAS.</p>

<p>He answered: <span class="lol">Lol</span> she is in the tent. 18:10.</p>

<p><span class="lol">lol</span>, where it comes again! [Re-enter Ghost.</p>

<p>He who shall say, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! I have slain a man!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, yonder, and Titinius mourning it. BRUTUS.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, to our help he cometh now! On to the fight!</p>

<p>And now, <span class="lol">lol</span>! it hath sprung up, and borne fruit.</p>

<p>Farewell Captaine 2.<span class="lol">Lol</span>.E. Sweet Mounsier Parolles Parr.</p>

<p>in shadowy scene <span class="lol">Lol</span>! Christmas children we: Drink-hael!</p>

<p>At one time it was, <span class="lol">Lol</span> here! and then it was, <span class="lol">Lol</span> there!</p>

<p>and the <span class="lol">lol</span> there! that amuses and cheats the multitude.</p>

<p>The dog obeyed, and shook himself; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! The treasure!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> you, here she comes! [Enter Lady Macbeth, with a taper.</p>

<p>*allotted &lt;92&gt; Such fine* hath, <span class="lol">lol</span>! this Troilus for love!</p>

<p>I knock the spurs away; <span class="lol">Lol</span>! I loosen belt and brand; Hark!</p>

<p>Ralph drew forth his sword and said: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span> then! I swear it.</p>

<p>By the Compassionate, I&#8217;m dazed about my case, for <span class="lol">lol</span>! vii.</p>

<p>Dead so long, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the thrill and stir of resurrection.</p>

<p>Sharrken looked at that horseman and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he was their chief.</p>

<p>or, <span class="lol">lol</span> there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</p>

<p>They raised up the hide, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they were unburnt under it.</p>

<p>I was on my way to the door of the cell when <span class="lol">lol</span>! and behold!</p>

<p>They are the means by which so many <span class="lol">Lol</span> heres! and <span class="lol">Lol</span> theres!</p>

<p>The third in order, underneath her, <span class="lol">lol</span>! Rachel with Beatrice.</p>

<p>Tis not his fault the spark 2.<span class="lol">Lol</span>.E. Oh &#8217;tis braue warres Parr.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, at their births good stars were opposite. QUEEN ELIZABETH.</p>

<p><span class="lol">lol</span>, ye know it! Speak therefore: shall I waste myself in vain?</p>

<p>He looked astonished, and says: &quot;Hel-<span class="lol">LOL</span>! Where&#8217;d YOU come from?</p>

<p>So he cast it down, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it became a serpent that ran along.</p>

<p>And all the time, <span class="lol">lol</span>! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, the blaze aspires! The glowing ocean reddens with the fires.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, thou sittest in thy pitch! &#8220;--&#8221;What do ye say, mine animals?</p>

<p>Then he turned about to the Lady, but <span class="lol">lol</span>! she had left his side.</p>

<p>Commit it Count 2.<span class="lol">Lol</span>.E. I am your accessary, and so farewell Ros.</p>

<p>We were going to catch her, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! this strumpet hath caught us!</p>

<p>/Al/ {...} and /<span class="lol">lol</span>/ {...} are the negatives (compare Heb. {...}).</p>

<p>So he threw down his rod, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it distinctly became a serpent.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, now one half of her flesh is consumed with the leprosy. 12:13.</p>

<p>cried the Caliph and whenas they counted heads, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there were ten.</p>

<p>--&quot;Detaching one corner of the mosquito-net, <span class="lol">lol</span>! I behold the moon!</p>

<p>But <span class="lol">lol</span>, a stir is in the air! The wave - there is a movement there!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, there is no requital. He who cannot command himself shall obey.</p>

<p>For, by Christ, <span class="lol">lol</span>! thus it fareth, It is not all gold that glareth.</p>

<p>In vain.--He nears the isle--and <span class="lol">lol</span>! His hand is on a shallop&#8217;s bow.</p>

<p>Why strikest thou me, <span class="lol">lol</span>, now this third time? Opened the mouth, etc.</p>

<p>Then drew he forth his hand, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was white24 to the beholders.</p>

<p>And when I looked around me, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there time was my sole contemporary.</p>

<p>[A pause] Tell me, nurse, how <span class="lol">lol</span> ng have we known each other? MARINA.</p>

<p>Or to drowne my cloathes, and say I was stript <span class="lol">Lol</span>.E. Hardly serue Par.</p>

<p>He answered: <span class="lol">Lol</span> I die, what will the first birthright avail me? 25:33.</p>

<p>I turned and <span class="lol">lol</span>! there was a man behind whom came a company of people.</p>

<p>Though I swore I leapt from the window of the Citadell <span class="lol">Lol</span>.E. How
deepe?</p>

<p>He stepped out: <span class="lol">lol</span>! in the east a dark speck on the face of the
desert.</p>

<p>&lt;1&gt; WHAT should these clothes thus manifold, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! this hot summer&#8217;s
day?</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, the scarlet letter which Hester wears! Ye have all shuddered at
it!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I teach you the Superman! The Superman is the meaning of the
earth.</p>

<p>Good morrow noble Captaine <span class="lol">Lol</span>.E. God blesse you Captaine Parolles
Cap.G.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a justified
man.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I hate Triumph and domination, wealth and ease, Thus sadly won!
Aho!</p>

<p>His life is rescued--<span class="lol">lol</span>, mine own! &quot; Amazement seized the circling
ring!</p>

<p>And the young man looked round and <span class="lol">lol</span>! old faces and places had
changed.</p>

<p>Man hath He created from a moist germ;2 yet <span class="lol">lol</span>! man is an open
caviller.</p>

<p>Tis She, and here, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! I unclothe and clear My Wishes&#8217; cloudy
character.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, this is the tarantula&#8217;s den! Would&#8217;st thou see the tarantula
itself?</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>&#8216;d have mercy on me, a sinner! &#8217; &#8217;Be merciful to poor me, or I&#8217;m
lost.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness.
54:9.</p>

<p>As they go, I think of the Greek, saying, &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! The Hellene leads the
way.</p>

<p>55:7 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
Selah.</p>

<p>The fresh wind caught the sail, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the good knights sat on the
Rhine.</p>

<p>Flower to console me and a pin cuts <span class="lol">lol</span>. Means something, language of
flow.</p>

<p>without thy powerful will; <span class="lol">Lol</span>! still he lives, pursues, and conquers
still!</p>

<p>-- They were these: <span class="lol">Lol</span>! &#8217;tis a gala night Within the lonesome latter
years!</p>

<p>After they had gone back, I arose and <span class="lol">lol</span>! my stomach was as you see it
now.</p>

<p>Oh pray, pray, pray, Manka reuania dulche <span class="lol">Lol</span>.E. Oscorbidulchos
voliuorco Int.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, this declaring ought enough suffice. Now hearken, if ye like for
to hear.</p>

<p>&lt;17&gt; See here the House of Fame, <span class="lol">lol</span> May&#8217;st thou not heare that I do? &#8220;
&#8221;What?</p>

<p>Deep-wounded, down he sinks at last, When, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the cranes&#8217; wings
rustle past.</p>

<p>For, one blast only, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they shall gaze around them, And shall
say, &quot;Oh!</p>

<p>But when we relieved them from the chastisement, <span class="lol">lol</span>! they broke their
pledge.</p>

<p>Thirty fadome <span class="lol">Lol</span>.E. Three great oathes would scarse make that be
beleeued Par.</p>

<p>Then Moses threw down his rod, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it swallowed up their cheating
wonders.</p>

<p>it is the table of their triumphs; <span class="lol">lol</span>! it is the voice of their Will
to Power.</p>

<p>It is; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, where youthful Edward comes! [Enter soldiers with
PRINCE EDWARD.</p>

<p>Then she went to the house-door and opened it, whereupon <span class="lol">lol</span>! the Wazir
entered.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright. &quot;
Ecclesiastes vii.</p>

<p>I passed by, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he was not; I sought his place, but it could not
be found.</p>

<p>There are those watching me who would say, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! He confesses himself
incapable.</p>

<p>I beheld, and <span class="lol">lol</span> there was no man: and all the birds of the air were
gone. 4:26.</p>

<p>So the keeper shut the gate, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the Lady Dunya came in by the
private door.</p>

<p>PURGATORY: Doctrinal, Historical and Poetical, BY MRS. J. SADLIER <span class="lol">LOL</span>!
PURGATORY!</p>

<p>I have held the question in heart, <span class="lol">lol</span>! these many years, watching for

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, <span class="lol">lol</span>, <span class="lol">lol</span>, <span class="lol">lol</span>, what modicums of wit he utters! His evasions have ears
thus long.</p>

<p>Thou didst confide in Isolani too; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! he was the first that did
desert thee.</p>

<p>But when we have rescued them, <span class="lol">lol</span>! they commit unrighteous excesses on
the earth!</p>

<p>He makes a pass before it, and, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold ye! it&#8217;s a screen
against the wall.</p>

<p>-- and <span class="lol">lol</span>! where lies (Her easement open to the skies) Irene, with her
Destinies!</p>

<p>Bertoldo and Albertazo are his seed: And, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the father walkes

<p>To hide with direr guilt Past ill and future, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the flower-de-luce
Enters Alagna!</p>

<p>I turned over the books impatiently, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! buried amongst them,
what met my eye?</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, Rochester stands here faste by. Ride forth, mine owen lord, break
not our game.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve but to speak the word, And <span class="lol">lol</span>, the maid is mine! I do not choose
To be denied.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, Louisa coming out of the house! Hastily cloaked and muffled, and
stealing away.</p>

<p>when <span class="lol">lol</span>! the earth clove asunder and swallowing the mule, closed up
again as before.</p>

<p>Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains, A life of labours, <span class="lol">lol</span>! what
fruit remains?</p>

<p>O&#8217;ermatch&#8217;d he falls; to two at once a prey, And <span class="lol">lol</span>! they bear the
bloody arms away!</p>

<p>Verily, it will be but a single blast, And <span class="lol">lol</span>! they are on the surface
of the earth.</p>

<p>He came to his own, and his own received him not; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he turns
unto the Gentiles.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> now, what hearts have men! they never mount As high as woman in her
selfless mood.</p>

<p>&#8217;&#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> now,&#8221; said Arthur, &quot;have ye seen a cloud? What go ye into the
wilderness to see?</p>

<p>Now, now he touches her, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! The mane He grasps, and now secures
her by the rein.</p>

<p>Ye felen wel your-self that I not lye; <span class="lol">Lol</span>, yond he rit! &#8217; Quod she,
`Ye, so he dooth!</p>

<p>and <span class="lol">Lol</span> theres! have been spread about the world, and religion been
made into a trade.</p>

<p>I laid him out stretching his arms and legs and looked at him, and <span class="lol">lol</span>!
he was smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then, <span class="lol">lol</span>! be these tidings, That thou nowe hither brings, That
thou hast heard?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, you, my lord, The net has fall&#8217;n upon me! I shall perish Under
device and practice.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> where they go! yea, let the children play: They get him not so
lightly, by my crown.</p>

<p>*dear <span class="lol">Lol</span>, how I wane, flesh, and blood, and skin; Alas! when shall my
bones be at rest?</p>

<p>And the left hand, <span class="lol">lol</span>! Mercury, with wings Quite in the middle
glittered silver bright.</p>

<p>See what a tempest direful Hector spreads, And <span class="lol">lol</span>! it bursts, it
thunders on our heads!</p>

<p>an undoubted serpent: And he drew out his hand, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was white7
to the beholders.</p>

<p>he takes Milan, in the league&#8217;s despite: <span class="lol">Lol</span>! with the youthful Sforza
makes accord: <span class="lol">Lol</span>!</p>

<p>No sir I warrant you <span class="lol">Lol</span>.E. But what linsie wolsy hast thou to speake

<p>There is no other way; &#8217;tis she must do&#8217;t: And, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the happiness! go
and importune her.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, he succeeded in this. The unprejudiced public rewarded him
with lavish applause.</p>

<p>Then spake we unto Moses, &#8220;Throw down thy rod;&#8221; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it devoured
their lying wonders.</p>

<p>When <span class="lol">lol</span>! a messenger, in furious course, Called to the dame to stay,
and rode and cried.</p>

<p>But when the day had broken through the shades Of chilly darkness, <span class="lol">lol</span>!
the torch of war!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, nece myn, see ye nought how I swete? 1465 I noot whether ye the

<p>And I passed by, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, he was not: and I sought him and his place
was not found. 36:37.</p>

<p>A wonder, lady!--<span class="lol">lol</span>, upon thy wish, Our messenger Chatillon is
arriv&#8217;d. [Enter CHATILLON.</p>

<p>Then if any man shall say to you, <span class="lol">Lol</span> here is Christ, or there: do not
believe him. 24:24.</p>

<p>And then if any man shall say to you: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, here is Christ. <span class="lol">Lol</span>, he is
here: do not believe.</p>

<p>Wa há,&#8220; etc., an interjection corresponding with the Syriac &#8221;ho&quot; <span class="lol">lol</span>!
(i.e., look) behold!</p>

<p>For <span class="lol">lol</span>, to this end serve the suppositions and parva logicalia.
Pannus, pro quo supponit?</p>

<p>But one blast shall there be,13 and, <span class="lol">lol</span>! they shall be assembled
before us, all together.</p>

<p>Nay, we will hurl the truth at falsehood, and it shall smite it, and
<span class="lol">lol</span>! it shall vanish.</p>

<p>And with that word he gan cast up the browe, Ascaunces, `<span class="lol">Lol</span>! is this
nought wysly spoken?</p>

<p>Five pieces, and again five were paid him, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the lad had his
head and the hound his.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, the night has vanished, the sun shines bright. Open thy eyes, look
hither and thither.</p>

<p>Then, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise: And <span class="lol">lol</span>! that instant,
godlike Hector dies.</p>

<p>320 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, here is al, what sholde I more seye? Doth what yow list, to

<p>O my dear lord, <span class="lol">lol</span> where your son is borne! [Enter soldiers, with the
body of young Talbot.</p>

<p>The leaves that he plucked he breathed upon, tossed into the air, and,
<span class="lol">lol</span>! they were birds.</p>

<p>Then drew they from his face the cloth; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! Beneath it Garban lay,
a corpse stone-cold.</p>

<p>Marphisa cries, &quot;Why is the feast delayed, When <span class="lol">lol</span>! the guests are
here, for whom we stayed?</p>

<p>Say it cuts <span class="lol">lol</span>. Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays
of flat silk stockings.</p>

<p>he exclaim&#8217;d, &quot;<span class="lol">lol</span> Dis! and <span class="lol">lol</span> the place, Where thou hast need to arm
thy heart with strength.</p>

<p>We observed them straightly and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they were cutters off of the
highway, wild as wild Arabs.</p>

<p>For <span class="lol">lol</span>, thy enemies have made a noise: and they that hate thee have
lifted up the head. 82:4.</p>

<p>when <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! I heard a noise of horse coming up and a voice
calling aloud, &#8217;Leave him!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, thou&#8217;lt see him lolling in his shop-front to be admired of this
people--marvelled at. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> his proud vessels scatter&#8217;d o&#8217;er the main, And unrevenged, his
mighty brother slain. &#8217; Oh!</p>

<p>Then threw he down his staff, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! an undoubted serpent: And he
drew out his hand, and <span class="lol">lol</span>!</p>

<p>Then silence came; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! The white dawn of the fourth fair Day of
God O&#8217;erflowed the world.</p>

<p>You showed how cuckolds are made, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, you were struck yourself by
the very same fate. EUR.</p>

<p>and <span class="lol">lol</span>, too late it cometh, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance.
But speed ye, speed ye!</p>

<p>The Stranger threw his vest back suddenly, And smiled in gentle pride,
and said, &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! I am he!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>; now: now see the issue of your peace Fra. Patience good Lady,
comfort gentle Constance Con.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, Farinata, there! who hath himself Uplifted: from his girdle
upwards all Expos&#8217;d behold him.</p>

<p>let us mend our speed; for now I tire not as before; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the hill
Stretches its shadow far.</p>

<p>So they took up the box by the lid, whereupon it flew open and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the
Prince was lying within.</p>

<p>And when you have done counting, <span class="lol">lol</span>! my master, a census of the sword
hands that await you; <span class="lol">lol</span>!</p>

<p>Again signs the king,-- And two gates open fly, And, <span class="lol">lol</span>! with one
spring, Two leopards out hie.</p>

<p>A woeful man was King Gunther, and he thought, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! now not the Devil
in Hell could escape her.</p>

<p>Again signs the king,-- The next gate open flies, And, <span class="lol">lol</span>! with a wild

<p>When he gazed abroad, <span class="lol">lol</span>! she was with Koorookh, on a far hill beyond
the stream in outer Aklis.</p>

<p>A star shot: &#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span>,&#8217; said Gareth, &#8216;the foe falls! &#8217; An owl whoopt: &#8217;Hark

finds it turned to flint-stone.</p>

<p>Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, hand in hand,

<p>Now one day as he sat in church, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the old woman came to him and
said, &quot;Go forth of the convent.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, what a great thing is affection! Men may die of imagination, So

<p>But the Easter morn soon dawns, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, Love ariseth! Love grieved, is
like a bird with wet wings.</p>

<p>Barbarous country, io <span class="lol">lol</span> creo: neither oil nor olives, bread nor
barley. You have been at Cordova.</p>

<p>So I looked and <span class="lol">lol</span>! there was a child lying asleep before her and
breathing heavily in his slumber.</p>

<p>A fine idea, <span class="lol">lol</span> throw snowballs at them. It made them go to one side
all right, and slowed them up.</p>

<p>The very <span class="lol">lol</span>- cation of it is secret. If you wish to know where it is
ask the first person you meet.</p>

<p><span class="lol">lol</span>, upon thy mighty breast Where hangs the baldrick! &#8220; Then to me he

<p>And she resum&#8217;d: &quot;If, but to hear thus pains thee, Raise thou thy
beard, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! what sight shall do!</p>

<p>And the while he went, <span class="lol">lol</span>! he saw a youth sitting at the door of a
house on his road and saluted him.</p>

<p>Nay, be pacified, for behold I am pledged to another, and <span class="lol">Lol</span>, we are
to be wedded this very day! MAR.</p>

<p>By and by says I, &#8220;Hel-<span class="lol">LOL</span>, Jim, looky yonder! &#8221; It was a steamboat

<p>This time the boy was large enough to say &#8220;Ate, Ate, he-cun-sin-<span class="lol">lol</span>. &#8221;

<p>Then, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan
Tallons. Then thin of the competition.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> you the skeleton and the bones and the grey stones! And the fire,

<p>most of its inmates were poor, and I stood at the gate of Hell, and
<span class="lol">lol</span>! most of its inmates were women.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here be my spectacles. To see me afar off, you would readily say

<p>I rede thee vaunt thee not of praise from us, for <span class="lol">lol</span>! Even as a

their native plain; <span class="lol">Lol</span>! he returns.</p>

<p>I looked round, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a tall figure stood close to me and gazed in
my face with anxious inquiring eyes.</p>

<p>every word right thus As I shal seyn; and who-so list it here, <span class="lol">Lol</span>!

<p>Sordello to himself Drew him, and cry&#8217;d: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> there our enemy! &#8221; And
with his hand pointed that way to look.</p>

<p>I beheld the earth, and <span class="lol">lol</span> it was void, and nothing: and the heavens,

<p>So we despaired of life and made sure of death when <span class="lol">lol</span>! a voice
repeated the saying, &quot;Allah is most Highest!</p>

<p>As I was casting about to steal the stallion <span class="lol">lol</span>! a great cloud of dust
arose on them and walled the horizon.</p>

<p>and <span class="lol">lol</span>! Sakra shone forth,--the God,--filling the earth And Heavens
with the thunders of his chariot wheels.</p>

<p>quoth they, &#8220;<span class="lol">lol</span>! thus say we, That all our will is to forego

<p>Thus it fell: One morning I was on the sea, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! An isle to Lerins

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold a bright idea dawned upon me! &#8220;What,&#8221; I thought, &quot;if
I meet him and don&#8217;t move on one side?</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span> a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased: hear ye him. 17:6.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, we must part awhile: it is written. &#8217; Said he, &#8217;Leave me not, my
betrothed: what am I without thy counsel?</p>

<p>We withdraw the day from it, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they are plunged in darkness; And
the Sun hasteneth to her place of rest.</p>

<p>I have declared thy justice in a great church, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I will not restrain

<p>The good mate said, &quot;Now must we pray, For <span class="lol">lol</span>! the very stars are
gone: Brave Admiral, speak; what shall I say?</p>

<p>And now, so to speak, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, Ben Adhem&#8217;s name led all the rest. &#8221; In

<p>When I heard her words, I arose startled and <span class="lol">lol</span>! in rushed a slave-
girl who cried, &#8217;Calamity hath come upon you.</p>

<p>As soon as the thing was ware of me, it fled from me into the inward

<p>Cotton Mather went to pray by the side of one of them, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the
child lost her hearing till prayer was over.</p>

<p>He said: &quot;Begone then hence: thou art accursed,23 And <span class="lol">lol</span>! my ban shall

<p>There he sat down with them, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a dust cloud advanced and a

<p>We slept together till the morning, when I would have gone out; but

<p>As I lay wondering at this <span class="lol">lol</span>! it ran upon me and smiting me with its

<p>At midnight, at cockcrow, at morning, one certain day, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the

<p>And when he came to the first cage he looked in and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a turtle dove,
on seeing him, raised her voice and cried out, saying, &quot;O Thou Bounty-

<p>And when morning morrowed the King went forth and sat in the guest-

<p>And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and he said to him: <span class="lol">Lol</span>

<p>Thence they struck into the uncultivated grounds, and crossing them
descended into a broad wilderness, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! in the midst of it stood a

<p>Behold,&#8220; she answered, &#8221;I journeyed here with my beloved husband, when

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, that is mine own child, who in the guise _4645 Of madness came,

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, my fellows, said he, yonder ye may see what a buffet he hath; that

<p>and scarce refrain To lift the glittering steel on high, For, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the

<p>So she put him in the third compartment and locked the door on him,

<p>Next she stood upon her right foot and said: &#8220;Hil-<span class="lol">lol</span>, hol-<span class="lol">lol</span>, hel-<span class="lol">lol</span>!
&#8221; After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice: &quot;Ziz-

<p>Then she turned to him with a face grown merry and smiling, and said:
&quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! how the poor lad yearneth for meat, as well he may, so long as

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, we are now in the city of Cades, which is in the uttermost of thy

and their horses!</p>

<p>IX Once to many a pealing shriek, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, from Ilion&#8217;s topmost tower,
Ilion&#8217;s fierce prophetic flower Cried the coming of the Greek! Black
in Hades sits the hour.</p>

<p>Now they have caughtsight of us,&#8220; said Skarphedinn, &#8221;for <span class="lol">lol</span>! they turn
their path elsewhither, and now we have no other choice than to run
down and meet them.</p>

<p>Arise, come away; night is past, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, it is day; My love, my
sister, my spouse, thou shalt hear me say-- Then I answer&#8217;d: Yea.
Christina Georgina Rossetti.</p>

<p>Meanwhile as he was on this wise, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there came in to him a black
slave big of body and bulk and holding a drawn sword in hand, who said
to him, &quot;Woe to thee!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I have set thee this day over the nations, and over kingdoms, to
root up, and to pull down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build,
and to plant. 1:11.</p>

<p>After this I beheld, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, another like a leopard, and it had upon
it four wings, as of a fowl, and the beast had four heads, and power
was given to it. 7:7.</p>

<p>III Once to many a pealing shriek, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, from Ilion&#8217;s topmost tower,
Ilion&#8217;s fierce prophetic flower Cried the coming of the Greek! Black
in Hades sits the hour.</p>

<p>grieve no more, <span class="lol">Lol</span> there the Trojans; bathe your swords in gore! This
day shall give you all your soul demands, Glut all your hearts, and
weary all your hands!</p>

<p>the imperial squadrons thither steer, Aid to the leaguered city to
convey; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! burnt, sunk, destroyed, they disappear, Encountered by
the Doria in mid-way.</p>

<p>Then I looked at him narrowly, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was my brother, so I rose to
him and welcomed him; then I seated him in my shop and put questions
concerning his case.</p>

<p>And I continued in this case knowing not whither I should go, when <span class="lol">lol</span>!
there came up two young men, as they were moons, each using as a staff
a rod of red gold.</p>

<p>And of the three children of Judah who refused the image of the
Babylonian, <span class="lol">lol</span>! that one who, in the feast to the thousand lords, so
confounded the astrologers.</p>

<p>It were, in truth, an idle risk and vain Into the moving wheel of time
to fall; The winged hours forever bear it on, The new arrives, and,
<span class="lol">lol</span>! the old has gone.</p>

<p>At moments he forgets; he rushes to embrace her; calls her his
beloved, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, her innocent kiss brings agony of shame to his face.
Daily the struggle endured.</p>

<p>The Duc De L&#8217;Omelette is terror-stricken; for, through the lurid vista
which a single uncurtained window is affording, <span class="lol">lol</span>! gleams the most
ghastly of all fires!</p>

<p>Imports indeed are gone with all their Dues-- <span class="lol">Lol</span>! Salt a Lever that I
dare not use, Nor may I ask the Tillers in Bengal-- Surely my Kith and
Kin will not refuse!</p>

<p>Then he passed the pottle to the Cook, who also said, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, I drink thy
health, sweet fellow! &#8221; Nor was he behind Little John in drinking any
more than in eating.</p>

<p>[FN#344] No sooner had he taken his place than <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! up came
Masrur and saluting him, sat down by his side and began talking and
talked with him awhile.</p>

<p>I am a servant, as my fathers were for generations; yet I could not
say to him, &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, master, my daughter! She is fairer than the Egyptian,
and loves thee better!</p>

<p>And when I was most charmed with listening to the birds, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a chiding
voice was heard of one approaching me and saying: &#8217;O knight, what has
brought thee hither?</p>

<p>139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, <span class="lol">lol</span>, O LORD, thou
knowest it altogether. 139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and
laid thine hand upon me.</p>

<p>and then it was, <span class="lol">Lol</span> there! Sometimes this power, and sometimes that
power, was to engage in the war, just as if the whole world was mad
and foolish like Britain.</p>

<p>But this it behoveth me not to speak of, though thou art to be my
brother-in-arms, since we are to tilt together presently: for <span class="lol">lol</span>!
yonder the tilt-yard, my lad.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, where comes that rock That I advise your shunning. [Enter Cardinal
Wolsey, the purse borne before him, certain of the Guard, and two
Secretaries, with papers.</p>

<p>And he sighed and recited these couplets, &quot;By the Compassionate, I&#8217;m
dazed about my case for <span class="lol">lol</span>! * Troubles and griefs beset me sore; I
know not whence they grow.</p>

<p>But he resembleth all the youths in this village, in that he is unduly
bashful in my presence, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, it is hard to bring him to the point.
But soft, he is here!</p>

<p>But no army sent we down out of heaven after his death, nor were we
then sending down our angels– There was but one shout from Gabriel,
and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they were extinct.</p>

<p>And when the Son of Mary was set forth as an instance of divine power,
<span class="lol">lol</span>! thy people cried out for joy thereat: And they said, &quot;Are our gods
or is he the better?</p>

<p>`<span class="lol">Lol</span>, holde thee at thy triste cloos, and I Shal wel the deer un-to thy

to paleys wente blyve.</p>

<p>And these men said to him: &quot;Be of good cheer, Enoch, be not afraid;
the everlasting God hath sent us to thee, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! to-day thou shalt
ascend with us into heaven.</p>

<p>He replied ‘Know that I was sitting one day at the window, when <span class="lol">lol</span>!
there passed by a man, singing the following distich, ‘Umm
Amr&#8217;,[FN#169] thy boons Allah repay!</p>

<p>So saying, she took his clothes and turband and clad him in the
cassock and the kerchief; but hardly had she done this, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! there
came a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>Orodes falls, equal fight oppress&#8217;d: Mezentius fix&#8217;d his foot upon his
breast, And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! here the
champion of my rebels lies!</p>

<p>He opened the door and entered when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! he saw the youth
lying on the bed, whereupon he turned to his wife and said to her,
&quot;What doth this youth here?</p>

<p>He took her at her word, and sat himself down to the wheel, and
whistled and sang: &#8217;Round about, round about, <span class="lol">Lol</span> and behold! Reel
away, reel away, Straw into gold!</p>

<p>22:38 And Balaam said unto Balak, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I am come unto thee: have I now
any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my
mouth, that shall I speak.</p>

<p>And in the city at noon he was full of fear, casting furtive glances
round him: and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the man whom he had helped the day before, cried
out to him again for help.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> in my arms not one son only but twain, gotten of thee, and on my
finger thy ring. &#8217;Tis time, then, that I be received of thee as thy
wife according to thy word.</p>

<p>There upon she uncovered her face and looked at him, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he was a
fair youth; so when she saw him she loved him and said, &quot;O my lord,
bring us something to eat.</p>

<p>She turns from this picture of ruin and death, And seeks the broad
casement again; And, <span class="lol">lol</span>! from the dews of her wasted breath Great
forests have grown on the pane.</p>

<p>When <span class="lol">lol</span>! a rocky cavern met his sight, Amid those precipices dark and
blind: Its sides descended thirty yards and more, Worked smooth, and
at the bottom was a door.</p>

<p>Where Fury calls him, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the felon hies, And brandishes on high his
trenchant blade, To assail the newly entered British band, Which
Edward and Sir Ariman command.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> you my Lord, The net has falne vpon me, I shall perish Vnder
deuice, and practise Bran. I am sorry, To see you tane from liberty,
to looke on The busines present.</p>

<p>Moses said to God: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I shall go to the children of Israel, and say
to them: The God of your fathers hath sent me to you. If they shall
say to me: What is his name?</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, said Dinadan, that helm is unhappy to us twain, for I had a fall
for it, and now, sir king, have ye another fall. Then Segwarides
asked: Who shall joust with me?</p>

<p>As they lay asleep, <span class="lol">lol</span>! two fierce Marids swooped down on them and,
taking each one on his shoulders, towered with them high in air, till
they were above the clouds.</p>

<p>Arabin had expected to find the man broken down by the weight of his
sorrows, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! at the first moment of their first interview he
himself began to ridicule them!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, how finely the Graces can it foote To the Instrument: They dauncen
deffly, and singen soote, In their meriment. Wants not a fourth Grace
to make the daunce even?</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return From service on the day.
Wear thou in look And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe, That
gladly he may forward us aloft.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here is the mother, and the daughter, and the daughter&#8217;s daughter.
Avarice is the mother: she brings forth bribe-taking, and bribe-
taking perverting of judgment.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here, this long-usurped royalty From the dead temples of this
bloody wretch Have I pluck&#8217;d off, to grace thy brows withal. Wear it,
enjoy it, and make much of it.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, that sun is in Italia&#8217;s skies This day, by grace of his good
sword in part. It beckons her to keep a warrior heart For guard of
beauty, all too sweet a prize.</p>

<p>And when he drew in his finger-legs, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there were the trail-roads
leading out and in like stays of a spider&#8217;s nest, into and from the
mid-most place he had covered.</p>

<p>The Monks in amazement shuddering stand, They burst through the
chancel&#8217;s gloom, From St. Edmond&#8217;s shrine, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a skeleton&#8217;s hand, _95
Points to the black marble tomb.</p>

<p>And they ceased not to eat and drink and chat, nibbling dry fruits and
laughing and playing tricks for the space of a full hour when <span class="lol">lol</span>! a
knock was heard at the gate.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> this have I found, said Ecclesiastes, weighing one thing after
another, that I might find out the account, 7:29. Which yet my soul
seeketh, and I have not found it.</p>

<p>If one so rude and of so mean condition May pass into the presence of
a king, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I present your grace a traitor&#8217;s head, The head of Cade,
whom I in combat slew. KING.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, now my glory smear&#8217;d in dust and blood! My parks, my walks, my
manors that I had, Even now forsake me, and of all my lands Is nothing
left me but my body&#8217;s length.</p>

<p>While he was in this case, <span class="lol">lol</span>! in came the master of the house, who
was a white slave, one of the chief men of the city, being Master of
the Horse[FN#388] to the King.</p>

<p>There was no need for him to take any steps to have it rebuilt, for,
when Elijah left the house, he prayed that the wall might erect
itself, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>! it stood upright.</p>

<p>Then he lay down again when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! The chest moved a second time, more
than before; whereupon he sprang to his feet and said, &quot;There it goes
again: but this is terrible!</p>

<p>and the gods shouted, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> and behold! &#8221; But he could not answer; his
jaws rattled, his limbs shook, the poison ran through his flesh as the
Nile floweth over the land.</p>

<p>Scarce respited from woes I yet appear, And scarce twelve morning suns
have seen me here; <span class="lol">Lol</span>! Jove again submits me to thy hands, Again, her
victim cruel Fate demands!</p>

<p>127:3 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
womb is his reward. 127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man;
so are children of the youth.</p>

<p>The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness, that <span class="lol">lol</span>, the days shall come
upon you, when they shall lift you up on pikes, and what shall remain
of you in boiling pots. 4:3.</p>

<p>Presently he made a sign with his eye, and there appeared before him
closets with closed doors, to which he spoke, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the voices of
birds answered him from within.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, what huge heaps of littleness around! The whole, a laboured quarry
above ground; Two Cupids squirt before; a lake behind Improves the
keenness of the northern wind.</p>

<p>But words are vain--Let Ajax once appear, And Hector trembles and
recedes with fear; Thou dar&#8217;st not meet the terrors of his eye; And
<span class="lol">lol</span>! already thou prepar&#8217;st to fly.</p>

<p>He gave it, and they ate: Then said he, &#8220;Kneel;&#8221; and taught them
prayer: but <span class="lol">lol</span>! Sudden the stag hounds&#8217; music dinned the wind; They
heard; they sprang; they chased it.</p>

<p>He muttered to himself, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, the poor thing&#8217;s madness is up with the
time! It hath changed with the great change that is come to the realm,
and now in fancy is he KING!</p>

<p>Presently the world waxed dark before our sight till we thought that
the sky was falling upon our heads, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the Ifrit presented
himself in his own shape and aspect.</p>

<p>Now, when Shibli Bagarag had so deliberated, he lifted his sight, and
<span class="lol">lol</span>, the old woman was no longer before him! He stared, and rubbed his
eyes, but she was clean gone.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I am revived by her for the great work. &#8217; Said Abarak: &#8217;O Master
of the Event, secure now without delay the two slaves of the Sword,
and lean the blade toward Aklis.</p>

<p>LXXXI He with the fullest pleasure overflows, That ever happy lover
did content: But, <span class="lol">lol</span>! this time a mighty tempest rose, And wasted
flowers, and trees uptore and rent.</p>

<p>Quoth the king, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, the three years are accomplished; come now, and
show me Khizr. &#8221; The poor man said, &quot;My king, grace and bounty are the
work of kings--forgive my sin.</p>

<p>She stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold,
was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy. He had followed her and
he greeted her with a chirp.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, with a noise that stunned me, the hair came out! O my betrothed,
what shrieks and roars were those: with which the Genie awoke, finding
himself bare of the Identical!</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, he sat on horseback at the door! And near him the sad nuns
with each a light Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen, To
guard and foster her for evermore.</p>

<p>come on; thy empty threats forbear; &#8217;Tis not thy arm, &#8217;tis thundering
Jove we fear: The skill of war to us not idly given, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! Greece is
humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.</p>

<p>XVIII Diligent, faithful secretary, <span class="lol">lol</span>! The learned Pistophilus, mine
Angiar here, And the Acciajuoli their joint pleasure show That for my
bark there is no further fear.</p>

<p>When however he had thereby come to the door of his cave, <span class="lol">lol</span>, then had
he again a longing for the good air outside, and for his animals,
--and wished to steal out. LXXVI.</p>

<p>For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I would readily forget the wanderings of Aeneas and all the
rest, rather than how to read and write. But over the entrance of the
Grammar School is a vail drawn!</p>

<p>Then again he looked, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the High House rising over the meadows
unburned and unhurt, and the banner of the fruited tree hanging forth
from the topmost tower thereof.</p>

<p>And, <span class="lol">lol</span>, she beheld a chariot of light, drawn by four shining eagles,
and preceded by angels. In this chariot lay the soul of Adam, which
the angels were taking to heaven.</p>

<p>After vainly attempting to dissuade him, the god allowed the dog to
assume its proper form, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was Dharma, the god of justice, and
the two entered heaven together.</p>

<p>So she made fast the tent-door and ran city-wards to seek a surgeon,
and anon having found a skilful leech, she returned with him, but <span class="lol">lol</span>
and behold! Khudadad was missing.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, fool,&#8217; he said, &#8216;ye talk Fool&#8217;s treason: is the King thy brother
fool? &#8217; Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrilled, &#8217;Ay, ay, my
brother fool, the king of fools!</p>

<p>4:24 I beheld the mountains, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they trembled, and all the hills
moved lightly. 4:25 I beheld, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, there was no man, and all the
birds of the heavens were fled.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> Citizens, he sayes he is Content. The warlike Seruice he ha&#8217;s done,
consider: Thinke Vpon the wounds his body beares, which shew Like
Graues i&#8217;th holy Church-yard Corio.</p>

<p>As he was reading <span class="lol">lol</span>! up came the slave-girl, looking right and left,
and seeing the paper in the jeweller&#8217;s hand, said to him, &quot;O my
master, this letter is one I let fall.</p>

<p>And I beheld: and <span class="lol">lol</span> a Lamb stood upon mount Sion, and with him an
hundred forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his
Father written on their foreheads. 14:2.</p>

<p>This continued till the third day at morning-tide, when he had washed
as was his wont and stood up to his prayers, and <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold!
another purse was dropped at his feet.</p>

<p>And, <span class="lol">lol</span>, as some sweet vision breaks Out from its native morning skies
With rosy shame on downcast cheeks, The virgin stands before his eyes.
A nameless longing seizes him!</p>

<p><span class="lol">lol</span>, my soul is tired, Make me thy plaything no more, I entreat! Ruark
laughed low, and said, &#8217;What is this dread of Rukrooth my mother which
weigheth on thee but silliness!</p>

<p>Then the seven arose and placed Shibli Bagarag on an elevation in the
midst of them, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a troop of black slaves leading by the collar,
asses, and by a string, monkeys.</p>

<p>Then all men turned, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, upon the lee Of Tenedos, beneath the
driving rain, The countless Argive ships were racing free, The wind
and oarsmen speeding them amain. XLVI.</p>

<p>Upon their heads the helmet, late unbound, They quickly place, and to
their steeds repair; And, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a knight and maid arrive, ere well The

<p>Verily, some eight or ten years ago I left thee a stripling lad, with
great joints and ill-hung limbs, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! here thou art, as tight a
fellow as e&#8217;er I set mine eyes upon.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, a spirit seizeth him, and he suddenly crieth out, and he
throweth him down and teareth him, so that he foameth; and bruising
him, he hardly departeth from him. 9:40.</p>

<p>And as they sat thus, behold a peal of thunder, and with the violence
of the thunder-storm, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there came a fall of mist, so thick that not
one of them could see the other.</p>

<p>From this unrest, <span class="lol">lol</span>, early wreck&#8217;d, A Future staggers crazy, Ophelia
of the Ages, deck&#8217;d With woeful weed and daisy! &#8217;&#8220; Murmuring, &#8221;Get

<p>40:16 <span class="lol">Lol</span> now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the
navel of his belly. 40:17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews

<p>and it was perfectly plain that what was meant was, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, what is Josh
Smith doing in Mariposa? &#8221; But this opposition had been countered by a
wide and sagacious philanthropy.</p>

<p>And whilst he was sitting, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there came a slave from the King, who
said to him, &#8220;The King calls for thee without stay or delay,&#8221; and he
answered saying, &quot;I hear and I obey.</p>

<p>Presently, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! up came the army of Al-Yaman, like a flock
of sheep, filling plain and steep, and Jamrkan and the Banu Amir fell
upon them, shouting, &quot;Allaho Akbar!</p>

<p>And, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! as the twain drew near one to other the Sultan was
certified that the Captain was none other than his beloved child,
Khudadad, whilome lost and now found.</p>

<p>This lasted through the first day and the second till the forenoon of
the third, when <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! a Knight advanced towards her, falcon
on fist and followed by a greyhound.</p>

<p>Then he stood gazing thereat when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the Figure came
forth the river with the seal-ring hanging to its neck and sprang upon
the saddle-bow in front of the Sultan.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, citizens, he says he is content: The warlike service he has done,

<p>And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and <span class="lol">lol</span>, the

<p>As they fare forth after the destruction, the herd of horrible beasts

<p>Louis took the eastern part, Lothaire (<span class="lol">Lol</span>-thaire&#8217;) took the central

<p>So bent she, mute, Fanning his face, and thinking &#8217;t was the day-- The
hour--which Narad named--the sure fixed date Of dreadful end--when,
<span class="lol">lol</span>! before her rose A shade majestic.</p>

<p>*guide <span class="lol">Lol</span>, all these folk so caught were in her las* *snare Till they

Although I could reckon a thousand mo&#8217;.</p>

<p>When <span class="lol">lol</span>! the shade, before his closing eyes, Of sad Patroclus rose, or

<p>Thereat my face and steps at once I turn&#8217;d Toward the sages, by whose

<p>So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the wheel
again, and whistled and sang: &#8217;Round about, round about, <span class="lol">Lol</span> and
behold! Reel away, reel away, Straw into gold!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, to the dangers of the fighting field The best, the dearest of my

Patroclus gone, I stay but half behind. Oh!</p>

<p>All that I promis&#8217;d, <span class="lol">lol</span>! I now perform: On twelve brave sons of Trojan
sires, with thee, The flames shall feed; but Hector, Priam&#8217;s son, Not

<p>I woke, all tears; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! my little sister, stiff and cold, Sat with
wide eyes upon the bed upright: That starry Lady with the bleeding
heart She, too, had seen, and heard her.</p>

<p>When <span class="lol">lol</span>! he saw a mead, o&#8217;ertopt with shade, Where a deep river wound
about the field, With narrow space between the turns it made, Where&#8217;er

<p>*assert Right so, <span class="lol">lol</span>, fareth it amonges us. He that the wisest

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, to my sight, beyond our hope restored, Achilles&#8217; car, deserted of

drivers guide them through the fight.</p>

<p>37:36 Yet he passed away, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he was not: yea, I sought him, but
he could not be found. 37:37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the

<p>Then she plucked a feather from her wing and dipped it in the dewey
elixir, which was then applied to the shriveled scalp, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it
became pliable and fresh as if just removed.</p>

<p>Around him stood fifty Mamelukes, white slaves, clothed in silks of
divers sorts holding their drawn swords in their hands; but when I
drew near to them <span class="lol">lol</span>! all were black stones.</p>

<p>Such were the surroundings amid which &#8220;The Love of Zion&#8221;, a Jewish
_Nouvelle Hé<span class="lol">lol</span>ïse_, appeared as the first plea for nature and love.
&#8220;The Love of Zion&#8221; is an historical romance.</p>

<p>my master, a census of the sword hands that await you; <span class="lol">lol</span>! a kingdom
ready fashioned for him who is to do &#8216;judgment and justice in the
whole earth&#8217;--in Rome not less than in Zion.</p>

<p>Or put it, my juvenile friends, that he saw an elephant, and returning
said &#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, the city is barren, I have seen but an eel,&#8217; would THAT be
Terewth? &quot; Mrs. Snagsby sobbing loudly.</p>

<p>Now hath that old magician given us of his worst for our good, and <span class="lol">lol</span>!
the good, pious pope there hath tears in his eyes, and hath quite
embarked again upon the sea of melancholy.</p>

<p>Thereupon the cock changed to a big fish, and plunged in after the
other, and the two disappeared for a while and <span class="lol">lol</span>! we heard loud
shrieks and cries of pain which made us tremble.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, in these windows that let forth thy life, I pour the helpless balm

<p>Presently, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the father returned and entered the house
when none of them expected him or was ware of him; and he heard their
play even before he went into the chamber.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, he cometh, leading on Hosts numberless, Aethiopia&#8217;s swarthy sons.
By this, I trow, he is nigh unto our gates; For long ago, in sore
distress of soul, I sent him urgent summons.</p>

<p>Then spake Hamdir, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> now, this is our last parting, for thou shalt
hear tidings of us, and drink one grave-ale (2) over us and over
Swanhild. &#8221; So therewith they went their ways.</p>

<p>By de time we got to de las&#8217; line of third verse de people was cryin&#8217;

<p>And I said: &#8217;Neither one thing nor the other: for <span class="lol">lol</span>! I have set thee
free, and I shall look to it that there shall be no pursuit of thee
till thou hast had time to get clear away.</p>

<p>That night he lay a-bed hard by the Erne-- The island-spangled lake--
but could not sleep-- When <span class="lol">lol</span>! beside him, pale, and sad, and stern,
Stood his dead master, risen from the deep.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, sudden the shift! To me seated secure came grief for joy when
Grendel began to harry my home, the hellish foe; for those ruthless
raids, unresting I suffered heart-sorrow heavy.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, brave AEneas sinks beneath his wound, Not godlike Hector more in
arms renown&#8217;d: Haste all, and take the generous warrior&#8217;s part. He
said;--new courage swell&#8217;d each hero&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>And of his signs also one is that the Heaven and the Earth stand firm

<p>O Master of the World, drive out the Famine as a moth out of thy

there is Yarni Zai, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! his cloak is tattered.</p>

<p>Thou didst, as one, Who, journeying through the darkness, hears a

<p>1673-1693) Father Zeus, surely great wonder rises in my mind, seeing
that dire destruction meets us not from disease and wounds alone, but
<span class="lol">lol</span>! even from afar, may be, it tortures us!</p>

<p>The squire was inclined to have compounded matters; when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! on a
sudden the wench appeared (I ask your ladyship&#8217;s pardon) to be, as it

<p>Dark was the earth and dank ere yet he reached That spot; and <span class="lol">lol</span>!
where lamb had lain, and dove Had mourned, and child had raced, there

<p>Abu Niyyah repaired to his patient, and scattered the Absinthium
beneath the soles of her feet, when, <span class="lol">lol</span>, and behold! she was made
whole, and she groaned and cried aloud, &quot;Where am I?</p>

<p>Sir Balaam now, he lives like other folks, He takes his chirping pint,

And <span class="lol">lol</span>! two puddings smoked upon the board.</p>

<p>SAY: He shall give life to them who gave them being at first, for in

<p>Long did I hold my peace concerning my sorrow of heart, and, <span class="lol">lol</span> now,
thy brother alone do I love; let us fall to other talk. &#8220; Gudrun said,
&#8221;Far beyond all this doth thine heart look.</p>

<p>So he rose and put forth his hand in most leisurely way and took out a
kerchief and unfolded it, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it contained an astrolabe[FN#611]
with seven parallel plates mounted in silver.</p>

<p>Accordingly, they repeated their talk, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the King rising from
his throne, gave a great cry and threw himself upon them, embracing
them and saying, &quot;By Allah, ye are my very sons!</p>

<p>It was the fifth round, yet the something had not come; and he had
said to himself, the sixth will bring it; but, <span class="lol">lol</span>! Ben-Hur was hardly

<p>18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the
time of life; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah
heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</p>

<p>At last the latter began: &quot;He who most loved and possessed him hath
now also lost him most--: --<span class="lol">Lol</span>, I myself am surely the most godless of

<p>The good soul advised the trembling man to be more generous in his
dealings with his fellows, and after a lecture on charity he vanished,
when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the old woman was there in his place.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>! from the darkly flowing tide Comes a vision white as a swan,
And an arm and a glistening neck are descried, With might and with
active zeal steering on; And &#8217;tis he, and behold!</p>

<p>But de good <span class="lol">Lol</span>&#8216;d was thar, an&#8217; I presently got strong enough to get up
an&#8217; took my slip in han&#8216;, an&#8217; staggered out dat yard, and cum up to

<p>Next from the squadron, whence had issued forth The first fruit of
Christ&#8217;s vicars on the earth, Toward us mov&#8217;d a light, at view whereof
My Lady, full of gladness, spake to me: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! <span class="lol">lol</span>!</p>

<p>Thereupon he put out his hand and raised the skirt of his garment,
when <span class="lol">lol</span>! the lower half of him appeared stone down to his feet while
from his navel to the hair of his head he was man.</p>

<p>And the Ziphites went up to Saul, in Gabaa, saying: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, doth not David
lie hid with us in the strong holds of the wood, in mount Hachila,
which is on the right hand of the desert. 23:20.</p>

<p>If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, Caesar is afraid&#8221;?
Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me

<p>So he went up to the hole and walked round it right warily, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it
was a deep pit, which the owner of the vineyard had dug to trap
therein the wild beasts which laid waste his vines.</p>

<p>For <span class="lol">lol</span>, a dead man&#8217;s heart, Achilles&#8217; heart, Is by our blood made warm
with life to-day! O child, dear child, that I might die with thee,
That earth might swallow me, ere I see thy doom!</p>

<p>83:2 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
have lifted up the head. 83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against
thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>

<p>Thou didst bid me come, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, I do thy bidding. I give myself to
thee as thy true servant, and will do thy commanding, even if it be to
the shedding of the last drop of my life&#8217;s blood.</p>

<p>She brought it to him, and he took it and read it; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it ran as
follows, &quot;After the usual salutations, I am well and in good health

<p>So she took a cup of water, graven with certain signs and conjuring

heard a great cry and the cup fell from her hand.</p>

<p>* *flattered See how he yawneth, <span class="lol">lol</span>, this drunken wight, As though he

<p>And she called on the All-powerful for aid, and ran with him into the
garden of the house, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! by the water side at the end of the
garden a boat full of armed soldiers with scimitars.</p>

<p>But when the One God is named, the hearts of those who believe not in
the life to come, shrivel up: but when the deities who are adored
beside Him are named, <span class="lol">lol</span>! they are filled with joy.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> thou trustest upon this broken staff of a reed, upon Egypt: upon

<p>But when she looked about the room, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! she espied the one-

she was certified that I had alluded to the beast.</p>

<p>and, <span class="lol">lol</span>! Out of the matter which thy pains control The statue springs!

<p>4:13 And when he came, <span class="lol">lol</span>, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man
came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</p>

<p>They saw lights in the chamber or ever they entered, and when they
came to the door, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there within was Katherine walking up and down

<p>And the King journeyed so far, whilst they kept saying to him, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! he
is here close at hand,&#8221; that he even went as far as Bizapor,[571]
which is the best city in all the kingdom of Daquem.</p>

<p>Then the brother pointed aloof with his finger and said: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span> you! fair

<p>Down through the Hall it swept; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! when the Kings and the people

clean shorn, the shaven side shining as the very moon!</p>

<p>4:23 I beheld the earth, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, it was without form, and void; and
the heavens, and they had no light. 4:24 I beheld the mountains, and,

<p>Amund goes out to the door of the booth, and when he got to the very
same spot on which he had stood when his eyes were opened, <span class="lol">lol</span>! they

<p>The league&#8217;s men hear the shrieks, behold the glow Of hostile fires,

<p>XXVI BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: -- &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, we seafarers say our

<p>So, presently he found himself in a long low room, sombrely lit,
roofed with crystals; and in a corner of the room, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a damsel on a

<p>When I entered the house I felt there was something comin&#8217; over me,

<p>But to vision alive under shallows of sight, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the Labourer&#8217;s crown

<p>two chiefs of force immense I see, Dreadful they come, and bend their

<p>So Khalif went in fearful because he had no place wherein to sleep
save upon the chest-lid when <span class="lol">lol</span>! as he stood, with ears listening for

<p>The tall brute stopped close by his horse, and Ben-Hur, looking up,
<span class="lol">lol</span>! Iras herself under the raised curtain looking down at him, her

<p>There saw I then Dan Citherus, And of Athens Dan Pronomus, &lt;29&gt; And
Marsyas &lt;30&gt; that lost his skin, Both in the face, body, and chin, For

<p>As for King Teghmus, he drew out his troops line after line and <span class="lol">lol</span>!
there were ten of ten thousand horses each, and with him were an
hundred champions, riding on his right hand and on his left.</p>

<p>So he rose and opened the door, when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! behind it was the very bird

<p>7:15 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, all the way was

<p>As he stood among the buildings, marvelling at their ordinance, <span class="lol">lol</span>!
his eyes fell on a damsel, young, beautiful and lovely, sitting under

<p>Erik: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, thy guilty disquiet lies heavy on thee; that man&#8217;s freedom

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! this was a troop of wild Arabs under a chief called

<p>But or ever they came on the foemen, they heard a great confused cry

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, said Sir Dinadan unto King Mark, yonder hoveth a knight that will

<p>I had framed my mind To hear of naught but warlike circumstance, Of
marches and attacks, and batteries; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! the duke provides, and

<p>The tempest is thus described: &quot;But <span class="lol">lol</span>! around the marsh&#8217;lling clouds

<p>Whilst he was praying and she was saying, &#8220;Amen,&#8221; and the thunder of

<p>But in his father&#8217;s arms Achilles&#8217; son Clad him and <span class="lol">lol</span>, he seemed
Achilles&#8217; self! Light on his limbs and lapping close they lay -- So
cunning was Hephaestus&#8217; workmanship -- Which for another had been a
giant&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, their countenances are as the sun, their existence as the desert;
barren are they in fruits and waters, a snare to themselves and to

the Jewel.</p>

<p>Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visage -
seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul - <span class="lol">Lol</span>, this is
human weakness: this also may be absolved! The First of the Seventy-

<p>So the Prince followed it until he was lost to every eye and the chase
got away from him in the waste; whereby he was confused and he knew
not which way to turn, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! a damsel appeared ahead and she was in
tears.</p>

<p>The Order&#8217;s sons demand, in haste, That with a crown his brow be
graced, And gratefully in triumph now The mob the youth would bear

&#8217;mongst the throng.</p>

<p>Fail before her, either in heart or in act, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, how the alluring
loves in her visage wither and sicken to what it is modelled on! Be
your Rubicon big or small, clear or foul, it is the same: you shall
not return.</p>

<p>9:19 If I speak of strength, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he is strong: and if of judgment, who
shall set me a time to plead? 9:20 If I justify myself, mine own mouth

perverse.</p>

<p>Presently as he lay, perplexed concerning his case, <span class="lol">lol</span>! he caught
sight of a ship sailing by and signalled with his sleeve to the
sailors, who came to him and took him up, saying, &quot;Who art thou and
whence comest thou?</p>

<p>Lay me as dead Upon a bier: above me spread yon cloth, And make your
wail: and when the seer draws nigh Worship him, crying, &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, our
friend is dead! Kneel, prophet, kneel, and pray that God thou serv&#8217;st
To raise him.</p>

<p>A little after came a woodcutter wight with a heavy load of fuel on
his back, and sat down by the spring to drink, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! back came the
first horseman in great trouble and asked him, &quot;Where is the bag which
was here?</p>

<p>And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with
the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I must die. 14:44
And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die,
Jonathan.</p>

<p>So on we journey&#8217;d through the evening sky Gazing intent, far onward,
as our eyes With level view could stretch against the bright
Vespertine ray: and <span class="lol">lol</span>! by slow degrees Gath&#8217;ring, a fog made tow&#8217;rds
us, dark as night.</p>

<p>And Isaac answered, and said unto his father, &#8220;I see, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a
pillar of fire and a cloud, and the glory of the Lord is seen upon the

<p>Nevertheless,&#8220; said Robin to himself, &#8221;I will baste thy hide right
merrily, my good fellow&#8220;; then, aloud, &#8221;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, here is my good staff,
lusty and tough. Now wait my coming, an thou darest, and meet me an
thou fearest not.</p>

<p>Then the voice ceased and not knowing whence it came to me I abode
perplexed; but <span class="lol">lol</span>! it again took up its lament and recited, &quot;Came
Rayya&#8217;s phantom to grieve thy sight * In the thickest gloom of the
black-haired Night!</p>

<p>* *undone <span class="lol">Lol</span>, lord, my lady hath my death y-sworn, Withoute guilt,

<p>But when he had made sure of his place on the water-side and purposed
returning to the palace, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! he saw a batel[FN#237] manned

capital.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, where the eyelashes of night are raised Yet lowly over morning&#8217;s

O too true!</p>

<p>48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:
and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, God hath shewed me also thy seed. 48:12 And Joseph brought

<p>9:39 And, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it

could not.</p>

<p>Preface ad fin: &quot;My family comes from <span class="lol">Lol</span>-an, and we are really
descended from Sun Tzu. I am ashamed to say that I only read my

the military technique.</p>

<p>The stars came out, and the faces of the four shone bright and clear,
but Shaun saw them not, for the labour of toiling and seeing was over
for Shaun; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! They were Asgool, Trodath, Skun, and Rhoog--The
gods of Old.</p>

<p>That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase, Depart thou, I solicit
thee no more,&#8217; Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive Let it not irk

yet I burn.</p>

<p>All thy enemies have opened their month against thee: they have
hissed, and gnashed with the teeth, and have said: We will swallow her
up: <span class="lol">lol</span>, this is the day which we looked for: we have found it, we have
seen it. 2:17.</p>

<p>When it was the Six Hundredth Night, She said, It hath reached me, O
auspicious King, that the youth after buying the veil of the merchant
bore it home; but hardly had he reached the house when <span class="lol">lol</span>! up came the
old woman.</p>

<p>The holy god opened his mouth, he spake and said, &quot;I went upon my way,
I walked after my heart&#8217;s desire in the two regions which I have made
to behold that which I have created, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a serpent that I saw not
stung me.</p>

<p>XIII <span class="lol">Lol</span>, their smoky limbs aloof, Shadowing heaven and the seas, Fates
and Furies, tangling Threes, Tear and mix above the roof: Fates and
fierce Eumenides. XIV Is the prophetess with rods Beaten, that she
writhes in air?</p>

<p>Time had gone but little distance, When a messenger appearing, Spake
these words to Kullerwoinen: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! thine aged sire has perished, Fallen
from thy race forever; Hasten home and do him honor, Lay him in the
lap of Kalma.</p>

<p>92:9 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, thine enemies, O LORD, for, <span class="lol">lol</span>, thine enemies shall
perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 92:10 But my
horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed
with fresh oil.</p>

<p>ye believers in gods all goodness, and in man all ill, <span class="lol">lol</span> you! see the
omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic,
and knowing not what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and
gratitude.</p>

<p>I shal stay here the for-horse to a smocke, Creeking my shooes on the
plaine Masonry, Till honour be bought vp, and no sword worne But one

the theft Parr.</p>

<p>But whilst they were thus engaged, <span class="lol">lol</span>! up came to them a duck in a
state of extreme terror, and stayed not faring forwards till she
reached the tree whereon were perched the two peafowl, when she seemed
re assured in mind.</p>

<p>This speech was spoken on the first of Moharram[FN#108]; and the
eldest Princess said to one of the sisterhood, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, the year is wholly
past and my uncle is not come. Rise, bring me the fire-sticks and the
box of perfumes.</p>

<p>So at last I took to pulling up the slabs[FN#126] of the house floor
and selling them by way of a livelihood, and one day as I did on this
wise, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! there opened in the floor a large vault whereinto
I descended.</p>

<p>Yet earth was preparing for another ruler, and kingdom by kingdom she
stole away from Night, and there marched through the dreams of men a
million heralds that cried with the voice of the cock: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! Morning
come behind us.</p>

<p>So was I speaking and weeping in the most bitter contrition of my
heart, when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! I heard from a neighbouring house a voice, as of boy
or girl, I know not, chanting, and oft repeating, &quot;Take up and read;
Take up and read.</p>

<p>I beheld, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, that horn made war against the saints, and prevailed
over them, 7:22. Till the ancient of days came and gave judgment to
the saints of the most High, and the time came, and the saints
obtained the kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, now was he veiled: Over sea stood a swelled cloud-rack: The
fishing-boat heavenward sailed, Bent abeam, with a whitened track,
Surprised, fast hauling the net, As it flew: sea dashed, earth shook.
She said: Is it night?</p>

<p>Howbeit Some little of this marvel he too saw, Returning o&#8217;er the
plain that then began To darken under Camelot; whence the King Looked
up, calling aloud, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, there! the roofs Of our great hall are rolled
in thunder-smoke!</p>

<p>There was a voice which sang about thy spring, Till winter froze the
sweetness of his lips, And <span class="lol">lol</span>, the worms had hardly left his tongue
Before thy nightingales were come again. O world, what courage hast
thou thus to sing?</p>

<p><span class="lol">lol</span>, here are bugs&lt;178&gt; Will make the hair stand upright on your heads,
And cast your crowns in slavery at their feet!-- Welcome, Theridamas
and Techelles, both: See ye this rout,&lt;179&gt; and know ye this same
king? THERIDAMAS.</p>

<p>He raised his head, And <span class="lol">lol</span>, before him lay the sea far ebbed Sad with
a sunset all but gone: the reeds Sighed in the wind, and sighed a
sweeter voice Oft heard in childhood--now the last time heard:
&#8220;Believe! &#8221; it whispered.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span> there, King&#8217;s Son and Sweet Lady, the end of all my tale. &#8220;
&#8221;Yea,&#8220; quoth Otter, &#8221;saving this, that even already thou has raised up
Utterbol from Hell to Earth, and yet meseemeth thou hast good-will to
raise it higher.</p>

<p>I continued sitting there, lost to the world, till sunset when <span class="lol">lol</span>! the
Kazi of the city came riding by with his slaves before him and his
eunuchs behind him, and dismounting entered the house in which the
damsel had appeared.</p>

<p>But as they were about to hoist him up, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the Captain of
the thieves, who had found him and reared him, came up at that moment
and asked, &quot;What be this assembly and the cause of the crowds here
gathered together?</p>

<p>The Sovran still sat motionless on his throne, where Shabbar went up
to him with lordly mien and royal dignity and cried, &quot;O King, thou
hast expressed a wish to see me; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, I am here. Say now what
wouldst thou have me do?</p>

<p>33:29 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 33:30 To
bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of
the living. 33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace,
and I will speak.</p>

<p>More than a hundred of <span class="lol">Lol</span> Shang&#8217;s soldiers entered the city in this
way, every one of whom was forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then charged
with all his forces, both inside and outside the city, and routed the
enemy completely.</p>

<p>Said Clement: &quot;He was hard to look into: but at least he looked not a
fierce or cruel man; nor indeed did he seem false or sly, though I
take him for one who hath lost his manhood-- but <span class="lol">lol</span> you! here he comes
across the court.</p>

<p>But, whilst they were thus in joy and jollity and mirth and merriment,
such as confoundeth the wit and the sight and defieth description, <span class="lol">lol</span>!
the Wazir awoke and, missing his brother, arose in affright and found
the door open.</p>

<p>One day, as he was thus employed, <span class="lol">lol</span>! he saw some slaves enter the
garden, leading mules laden with carpets and vessels, and asked them
the meaning of this, to which they answered, &quot;The Princess is minded
to take her pleasure.</p>

<p>The King, deeply irritated, committed me to the care of another
officer of his bodyguard who was named Monsignor <span class="lol">lol</span> Iscontro d’Orbech.
[3] By him I was accommodated with all that I required in the most
gracious way imaginable.</p>

<p>*allure <span class="lol">Lol</span> here our silver ready for to spend. &quot; This miller to the
town his daughter send For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose,
And bound their horse, he should no more go loose: And them in his own
chamber made a bed.</p>

<p>But when she had walked to some distance she was minded to see the
iron door, so might she with ease know it again; so she went back, but
<span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the entrance had vanished and was invisible to her as
to all other women.</p>

<p>When other lovers in arms across Rejoice their chief delight, Drowned
in tears, to mourn my loss I stand the bitter night In my window where
I may see Before the winds how the clouds flee: <span class="lol">Lol</span>! what a mariner
love hath made me!</p>

<p>And still call thou her Woman in thy thought; Her whom, if thou
thyself deceivest not, Thou wilt behold decked with such loveliness,
That thou wilt cry [Love] only Lord, <span class="lol">lol</span>! here _50 Thy handmaiden, do
what thou wilt with her.</p>

<p>The rest thou knowest.--<span class="lol">Lol</span>! we two are here-- We have survived a ruin
wide and deep-- Strange thoughts are mine.--I cannot grieve or fear,
Sitting with thee upon this lonely steep I smile, though human love
should make me weep.</p>

<p>But we prayed to <span class="lol">Lol</span>&#8216;d Jesus to take keer on &#8216;em all dese years, an&#8217;
we&#8217;ll go home to glory soon. &#8220; In answer to my query as to his age, he
said: &#8221;Massa Moses&#8217; book say I&#8217;s a hundred an&#8217; five, an&#8217; my Milla&#8217;s a
hundred an&#8217; three.</p>

<p>This increased my yearning for him and the ceremonies were tedious to
me and I prayed Almighty Allah to give me sight of him; nor was it but
a few days after, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! one pulled me from behind, and I turned and
it was he again.</p>

<p>But one day, and it was the namesake of the day when his father had
promised him to the sea-maiden, they were sauntering by the side of
the loch, and <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! she came and took him away to the loch
without leave or asking.</p>

<p>After this inspection I seated myself amiddlemost the saloon,
misdoubting; and <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! as I sat, there came down on me from
the dais a body of seven naked men, without other clothing than
leather belts about their waists.</p>

<p>My brother was patient and did her bidding and let shave off his beard
and, when he was brought back to the lady, <span class="lol">lol</span>! he appeared dyed red as
to his eyebrows, plucked of both mustachios, shorn of his beard,
rouged on both cheeks.</p>

<p>A little before daybreak, they set out, and Hasan with them, and fared
on till they came to their camp, where they dispersed each to her
tent, and Hasan followed one of them and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was hers for whose
protection he had prayed.</p>

<p>*benediction <span class="lol">Lol</span> Judith, as the story telle can, By good counsel she
Godde&#8217;s people kept, And slew him, Holofernes, while he slept. <span class="lol">Lol</span>
Abigail, by good counsel, how she Saved her husband Nabal, when that
he Should have been slain.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, these; all turning to me as I ask my thoughts the question! Here
is my aunt, in stronger spectacles, an old woman of four-score years
and more, but upright yet, and a steady walker of six miles at a
stretch in winter weather.</p>

<p>Thereupon Alaeddin arose and kissed his mother&#8217;s hand and thanked her,
enhancing her kindly service: then he left her and entering his
chamber took the Lamp and rubbed it when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! its Slave
appeared and cried, &quot;Adsum!</p>

<p>Oh, I track the fairest fair Through new haunts of pleasure;
Footprints here and echoes there Guide me to my treasure: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! she
turns--immortal youth Wrought to mortal stature, Fresh as starlight&#8217;s
aged truth-- Many-named Nature!</p>

<p>Everyone of us could <span class="lol">lol</span> something. One fellow had a good voice,
another fellow was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song,
another was a good oarsman or a good racket player, another could tell
a good story and so on.</p>

<p>It was not so to the tribune; he confounds it with pomarium, an
orchard, translates <span class="lol">lol</span> Jardino de Roma cioene Italia, and is copied by
the less excusable ignorance of the Latin translator (p. 406) and the
French historian, (p. 33.</p>

<p>* *as if it were a disgrace <span class="lol">Lol</span> here, the wise king Dan* Solomon, *Lord

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> Abigail, by good counsel, how she Saved her husband Nabal, when
that he Should have been slain. And <span class="lol">lol</span>, Esther also By counsel good

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, there entered one of the clan of the O&#8217;Molloy&#8217;s, a comely hero
of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty&#8217;s counsel learned
in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of
Lambert. --Hello, Ned.</p>

<p>Now he stood up again and was just going to speak, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! she put
both her palms to her face, and her bosom heaved, and her shoulders
were shaken with sobs, and she burst out a weeping, so that the tears
ran through her fingers.</p>

<p>Thereupon the King who wore gauntlets of skin to guard him against
poisons took the cup from the hawk&#8217;s neck, and filling it with the
water set it before the bird, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the falcon struck it with her
pounces and upset the liquid.</p>

the French King Henry III.</p>

<p>Sisterly and blissful rapture softens Gloomy Melancholy&#8217;s fearful
night, And, deliver&#8217;d of its golden children, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the eye pours forth
its radiance bright! Does not awful Sympathy rule over E&#8217;en the realms
that Evil calls its own?</p>

<p>Such are (1) the SHIH LIU TS`E (1 CHUAN), preserved in the YUNG <span class="lol">LOL</span> TA
TIEN; (2) CHIANG YUAN (1 CHUAN); and (3) HSIN SHU (1 CHUAN), which
steals wholesale from Sun Tzu. None of these has the slightest claim
to be considered genuine.</p>

<p>Scarce the ascent Began, when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a panther, nimble, light, And
cover&#8217;d with a speckled skin, appear&#8217;d, Nor, when it saw me, vanish&#8217;d,
rather strove To check my onward going; that ofttimes With purpose to
retrace my steps I turn&#8217;d.</p>

<p>So he rose and went on to a little to an inner door and looked in and
<span class="lol">lol</span>! he was in the very chamber wherein the bride had been displayed to
him; and there he saw the bridal alcove and the settle and his turband
and all his clothes.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, whilst I slept, in dreams I saw thee lying by my side And, from
thy lips the sweetest, sure, of limpid springs did drain. Yea, true
and certain all I saw is, as I will avouch, And &#8217;spite the envier,
thereto I surely will attain.</p>

<p>Why, take it all: <span class="lol">lol</span>, have it every deal,* *whit Peter! &lt;19&gt; shrew*
you but ye love it well *curse For if I woulde sell my *belle chose*,
*beautiful thing* I coulde walk as fresh as is a rose, But I will keep
it for your owen tooth.</p>

<p>And as I held it in my hand, I found it heavy of weight, and opening
out the folds felt somewhat tied up in one of the corners of the
cloth;[FN#288] so I unrolled the swathes when <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! I came
upon the purse of gold pieces.</p>

<p>10 I have seen the foolish taking root, but <span class="lol">lol</span>, their habitation was
presently consumed. 11 Their children were far from safety, they
perished at the gates of those who were lesser than themselves: and
there was no man to help them.</p>

<p>Now, they had passed the cultivated fields, and were halting by the
ford of a river bordering the Desert, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! a warrior on the
yonside, riding in a cloud of dust, and his shout was, &#8217;The King
Mashalleed is defeated, and flying.</p>

<p>Now shall it fall?--A wandering stream of wind, Breathed from the
west, has caught the expanded sail, And, <span class="lol">lol</span>! with gentle motion,
between banks Of mossy slope, and on a placid stream, _400 Beneath a
woven grove it sails, and, hark!</p>

<p>Then he felt a hand come on to his cheek, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, Ursula beside him,
her cheeks flushed and her eyes glittering; and she cried out: &#8220;O
thine home, my beloved, thine home! &#8221; And he turned to her and said;
&quot;Yea, presently, sweetheart!</p>

<p>So he rose to his feet and, opening the door, looked out and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he
was ware of a light afar off in the direction of the city gate; then
walking a little way towards it, he saw that it was on the road
whereby he had reached the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> thus was the old custom and usage of this land; and also men say
that we of this land have not yet lost nor forgotten that custom and
usage. Alas, this is a great default of us Englishmen, for there may
no thing please us no term.</p>

<p>Then was Kadrab wroth, and kicked the old beggar with his fore-foot,
lifting him high in air, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he did not alight, but rose over the
roofs of the houses and beyond the city, till he was but a speck in
the blue of the sky above.</p>

<p>But when I thought he meant To crush me, moving on me, <span class="lol">lol</span>! he, too,
Opened his arms to embrace me as he came, And up I went and touched
him, and he, too, Fell into dust, and I was left alone And wearying in
a land of sand and thorns.</p>

<p>25:29 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my
name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished:
for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth,
saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>1:44 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine
ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 1:45 And blessed is she that
believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were
told her from the Lord.</p>

<p>The dark-faced priest finds himself wondering if the fly too has faced
its Valley of Humiliation, and if it will plunge into it,--when <span class="lol">lol</span>! it
spreads its tiny wings and buzzes merrily across, leaving the watcher
wing- less and alone.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, are they not full of their old leaven, who say to us, &quot;What was
God doing before He made heaven and earth? For if (say they) He were
unemployed and wrought not, why does He not also henceforth, and for
ever, as He did heretofore?</p>

<p>`<span class="lol">Lol</span>, yond saugh I myn owene lady daunce; 565 And in that temple, with

<p>And Moses said before the Lord: <span class="lol">Lol</span> I am of uncircumcised lips, how

they turn the rod into a serpent; and the waters of Egypt into blood,
which was the first plague.</p>

<p>As they were speaking, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the Caliph entered and Ala al-Din rising,
kissed the ground before him and said, &quot;Allah keep thee, O Prince of

thy bounty and beneficence!</p>

<p>(And filled a horn with wine and held it to her,) &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! I, myself, when
flushed with fight, or hot, God&#8217;s curse, with anger--often I myself,
Before I well have drunken, scarce can eat: Drink therefore and the
wine will change thy will.</p>

<p>73:27 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. 73:28 But it is good
for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that
I may declare all thy works.</p>

<p>CCXIV Now to be off would that Emperour Charles, When pagans, <span class="lol">lol</span>!
comes surging the vanguard; Two messengers come from their ranks
forward, From the admiral bring challenge to combat: &quot;&#8217;Tis not yet
time, proud King, that thou de-part.</p>

<p>I thus my guide address&#8217;d: &#8220;Upraise thine eyes, <span class="lol">Lol</span> that way some, of
whom thou may&#8217;st obtain Counsel, if of thyself thou find&#8217;st it not! &#8221;
Straightway he look&#8217;d, and with free speech replied: &quot;Let us tend
thither: they but softly come.</p>

<p>RETURN again, said Sir Launcelot, for your quest is done, for I have
met with Sir Tristram: <span class="lol">lol</span>, here is his own person! Then was Sir
Gawaine glad, and said to Sir Tristram: Ye are welcome, for now have
ye eased me greatly of my labour.</p>

<p>So saying, she went up to a tree and, spreading the carpet under it,
lay down, and called to him to come and do her need, when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! her
husband, who had followed them unawares and saw this, called out to
the page, saying, &quot;Harkye, boy!</p>

<p>An of negro chattels ten thousand head * Wouldst have, or Kings who be
proud and prow Or chargers led for thee day by day * And virgin girls
high of bosom, <span class="lol">lol</span>! Al-Yaman land my command doth bear * And my biting
blade to my foes I show.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, thus bejaped* and beguil&#8217;d was he; *tricked Thus made he his
introduction To bringe folk to their destruction. Consider, Sirs, how

<p>Presently, the cockle-shell rose upon one very lofty swell, and Shibli
Bagarag lost hold of it, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was overturned and engulfed in the
descent of the great mountain of water, and the Princess Goorelka was
immersed in the depths.</p>

<p>I believed thou wert dead these seven years, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, here thou art
alive! I knew thee the moment I saw thee; and main hard work it was to
keep a stony countenance and seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves
and rubbish o&#8217; the streets.</p>

<p>Instead of which, <span class="lol">lol</span>! and behold, old Margery, Maggie the housemaid,
Macdonald the gardener, and Macalister the game-keeper, all speak a
rather purer English than I do; far more carefully pronounced, and
with every R sounded and rolled.</p>

<p>I turned my face and no less soon my steps Unto the Sages, who were
speaking so They made the going of no cost to me; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! were heard a
song and a lament, &#8220;Labia mea, Domine,&#8221; in fashion Such that delight
and dolence it brought forth.</p>

<p>Now he had been gone but a little while, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! I heard a noise of
cries and found myself in the midst of a multitude of folk whose eyes
were in their breasts; and seeing me quoth they, &#8217;Who art thou and
what cast thee into this place?</p>

<p>this pillere, Of which that I you telle here, Of lead and iron both,
y-wis; For iron Marte&#8217;s metal is, &lt;62&gt; Which that god is of battaile;
And eke the lead, withoute fail, Is, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the metal of Saturn, That
hath full large wheel* to turn.</p>

<p>Thinking thus he drew forth the mirror from his pouch and considered
her image carefully when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the crystal was bright and
clean as virgin silver and when he eyed her semblance in the glass he
saw it pure as a white dove&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Princess in male attire fell to going every morning
and meeting the Sultan&#8217;s daughter, till one day of the days she went
in and the twain sat down and laughed and enjoyed themselves, when <span class="lol">lol</span>
and behold! the King entered.</p>

<p>2:9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the star,
which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood
over where the young child was. 2:10 When they saw the star, they
rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</p>

<p>Presently Husn Maryam arose and looked up and saw a cloud of dust
which spread till it walled the view, then it lifted and flew, and <span class="lol">lol</span>!
stood disclosed her brother and his troops, crying aloud, &quot;Whither
will ye fly, and we on your track!</p>

<p>[124] Now, though the subjects of the MS are various, yet the hand-

<p>But in the field were Lancelot&#8217;s kith and kin, Ranged with the Table
Round that held the lists, Strong men, and wrathful that a stranger
knight Should do and almost overdo the deeds Of Lancelot; and one said
to the other, &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! What is he?</p>

<p>They quitte him out to rathe; 205 O nyce world, <span class="lol">lol</span>, thy discrecioun!

<p>When the Egyptians saw us, they approached to kill us, but Thou in Thy
great mercy didst bid the earth swallow us and set us in another
place, where we were not seen by the Egyptians, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! in this way
didst Thou save us from their hand.</p>

<p>As she spoke <span class="lol">lol</span>! there came a loud knocking at the door; so she went
and opened, and suddenly, my friend, whom I had thrown down on the
bridge, appeared with his head bound up, the blood running down upon
his clothes and without his horse.</p>

<p>For saying through the land that he was the Messiah, they had brought
the Nazarene to the cross; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>! on the cross, more confidently
than ever, he had not only reasserted himself, but promised enjoyment
of his Paradise to a malefactor.</p>

<p>Hereupon the King cried, &#8220;By Allah, ye be certainly my sons,&#8221; when <span class="lol">lol</span>
and behold! the woman came forwards and repeated to him all that the
Wazirs had related whereby it was certified that she was the King&#8217;s
lost wife and their lost mother.</p>

<p>Yonder the fairy chest!--come, maid, behold The bridegroom&#8217;s gifts--
the armlets--they are gold, And paste out-feigning jewels!--lead the
bride Into the odorous bath--<span class="lol">lol</span>! unguents still-- And still the
crystal vase the arts for beauty fill!</p>

<p>On one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than
usual, while Madame de <span class="lol">Lol</span> was relating once again the details of all
these inheritances and all these &#8220;expectations. &#8221; She interrupted
herself impatiently: &quot;Mon Dieu, cousin!</p>

<p>Fondly I gaz&#8217;d Upon those patterns of meek humbleness, Shapes yet more
precious for their artist&#8217;s sake, When &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>,&#8221; the poet whisper&#8217;d,
&quot;where this way (But slack their pace), a multitude advance. These to
the lofty steps shall guide us on.</p>

<p>As in a quiet and clear lake the fish, If aught approach them from
without, do draw Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew Full more
than thousand splendours towards us, And in each one was heard: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>!
one arriv&#8217;d To multiply our loves!</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the young man shook and trembled; then he rose to
his feet and, rejoicing at his deliverance, cried aloud, &quot;I testify
that there is no god but the God, and in very truth Mohammed is His
Apostle, whom Allah bless and keep!</p>

<p>Thereupon I arose and entered the vestibule and sat down on the settle
there, and, as I sat, <span class="lol">lol</span>! another damsel came out and said to me, &#8217;O
my lord my mistress biddeth thee enter and sit down at the door of the
saloon, to receive thy money.</p>

<p>That opportunity, <span class="lol">lol</span>! it comes yonder Approaching with swift steeds;
then with a swing Throw thyself up into the chariot-seat, Seize with
firm hand the reins ere thy opponent Anticipate thee, and himself make
conquest Of the now empty seat.</p>

<p>Beauty to me brought guilt--its bloom destroyeth <span class="lol">Lol</span>, in the judgment

<p>Presently, we read, &quot;Helen of the fair face came up with the robe in
her hands, and spake: &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! I too give thee this gift, dear child, a
memorial of the hands of Helen, for thy bride to wear upon the day of
thy desire, even of thy marriage.</p>

<p>16:29 His disciples said unto him, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, now speakest thou plainly, and
speakest no proverb. 16:30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all

believe that thou camest forth from God.</p>

<p>For when the actors in a farce began a well-known song, Venit, io,
Simus [665] a villa: <span class="lol">Lol</span>! Clodpate from his village comes; all the
spectators, with one voice, went on with the rest, repeating and
acting the first verse several times over.</p>

<p>When the mist was on the rice-fields an&#8217; the sun was droppin&#8217; slow,

<p>But fly the boundary of the senses--live The ideal life free thought

impotent despair be gone! And with divinity thou sharest the throne,
Let but divinity become thy will!</p>

<p>He rose and past; then Kay, a man of mien Wan-sallow as the plant that
feels itself Root-bitten by white lichen, &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span> ye now! This fellow hath

<p>Wainamoinen, old and trusty, Turned his face, and looked about him,
<span class="lol">Lol</span>! there comes a spring-time cuckoo, Spying out the slender birch-

tree Left unharmed of all the forest?</p>

<p>23:9 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I
behold him: <span class="lol">lol</span>, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
reckoned among the nations. 23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and
the number of the fourth part of Israel?</p>

<p>27:7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
ways, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and
Judah. 27:8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign,
and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>At length there recurred, somehow, to my mind the words which,
impressive though they be, never can assuage sorrow--the words: &#8220;Weep
not for me, Martha, nor gaze into the tomb, for, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I am risen! &#8221;
Nay, and never would THIS man rise again.</p>

<p>And so the thirty knights passed on and came by Sir Tristram and by
Sir Dinadan, and then Sir Tristram cried on high: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, here is a knight
against you for the love of Sir Launcelot. And there he slew two with
one spear and ten with his sword.</p>

<p>Whilst the whelp was thus conversing with the horse <span class="lol">lol</span>! there rose a
cloud of dust and, presently opening out, discovered below it a
furious camel gurgling and pawing the earth with his feet and never
ceasing so to do till he came up with us.</p>

<p>On such wise fared it with them; but as regards Sayf al-Muluk, whilst
he walked in the garden, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! five Jinn of the people of the
Blue King espied him and said to one another, &quot;Whence cometh yonder
wight and who brought him hither?</p>

<p>The former does evil on a large scale, and, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! therfor is he cleped a

<p>To Dudon&#8217;s government, by sea or land A leader sage, the navy was
consigned; Which yet lay anchored off the Moorish strand, Expecting a
more favourable wind, To put to sea; when, freighted with a load Of
prisoners, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a vessel made the road.</p>

<p>Then very softly to her presence move, And whisper: &#8220;Lady, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they

<p>On the morrow, Gharib made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the two-bow
dawn-prayer, offering up praise and thanks to Almighty Allah; when, <span class="lol">lol</span>
and behold! there arose a clamour and confusion in the meadows, and he
bade Sahim go see what was to do.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here hath kind* her domination, *nature And appetite flemeth*
discretion. *drives out A she-wolf hath also a villain&#8217;s kind The

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, the Doctor, always our good friend, labouring at his
Dictionary (somewhere about the letter D), and happy in his home and
wife. Also the Old Soldier, on a considerably reduced footing, and by
no means so influential as in days of yore!</p>

<p>Now on that day he arose at dawn and, according to his custom, looked
out when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! he saw before him an edifice; so he rubbed
his eyes and considered it curiously when he became certified that it
was the pavilion of his son-in-law.</p>

<p>Now, when he had risen from the soft green bank that was his couch,
<span class="lol">lol</span>, at his feet a damsel weeping! So he lifted her by the hand, and
she arose and looked at him, and began plaining of love and its
tyrannies, softening him, already softened.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, Shibli Bagarag stepped from it through a casement of the Hall, and
with him Shagpat, a slack weight, mated out of all power of motion.
Koorookh swooped low, on his back Baba Mustapha, and Shibli Bagarag
flung Abarak beside him on the bird.</p>

<p>your timely aid unite; <span class="lol">Lol</span>, great AEneas rushes to the fight: Sprung
from a god, and more than mortal bold; He fresh in youth, and I in
arms grown old. Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,
The great dispute, of glory, or of life.</p>

<p>When, whether the first lot Gradasso drew, Or young Rogero held the
honor light, The King of Sericane his bugle blew, And the rock rang
and fortress on the height; And, <span class="lol">lol</span>! apparelled for the fearful
course, The cavalier upon his winged horse!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, things in the ecclesiastical books are not absurd to us now, which
sometimes seemed absurd, and may be otherwise taken, and in a good
sense. I will take my stand, where, as a child, my parents placed me,
until the clear truth be found out.</p>

<p>Infatuate, who from such a good estrange Your hearts, and bend your
gaze on vanity, Alas for you!--And <span class="lol">lol</span>! toward me, next, Another of
those splendent forms approach&#8217;d, That, by its outward bright&#8217;ning,
testified The will it had to pleasure me.</p>

<p>So he kissed her and set her between his thighs; then, sitting to her
as a man sitteth to a woman,[FN#111] he took yard in hand and drew her
towards him and weighed down upon her, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! he heard one saying to
him, &quot;Awake, thou ne&#8217;er-do-well!</p>

<p>At last, the bridegroom was summoned to the chamber where she sat
enthroned; and he rose slowly and with dignity from his divan; but in
so doing, for that he was over full of meat and drink, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold!
he let fly a fart, great and terrible.</p>

<p>So we made towards it, and ceased not walking till we reached the door
thereof when <span class="lol">lol</span>! a number of naked men issued from it and without
saluting us or a word said, laid hold of us masterfully and carried us
to their king, who signed us to sit.</p>

<p>So Princess Perizadah&#8217;s heart was set at rest and taking the three
prizes with her she fared forth and scattered a few drops from the
silver flagon upon each black stone as she passed it when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold! they came to life as men and horses.</p>

<p>But the usurper had the better of the battle and purposed to seize the
young King amidst his many when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! appeared a Knight
backing a coal-black mare; and he was armed cap-à-pie in a coat of
mail, and he carried a spear and a mace.</p>

<p>I calculated on a prudent son, Who would have blessed the hand
beneficent That plucked him back from the abyss--and <span class="lol">lol</span>! A fascinated
being I discover, Whom his two eyes befool, whom passion wilders, Whom
not the broadest light of noon can heal.</p>

<p>4:25 I beheld, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, there was no man, and all the birds of the
heavens were fled. 4:26 I beheld, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the fruitful place was a
wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the
presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</p>

<p>And all your blessings are assuredly from God: then, when trouble
befalleth you, to Him ye turn for help: Then when He relieveth you of
the trouble, <span class="lol">lol</span>! some of you join associates with your Lord:– To prove
how thankless are they for our gifts!</p>

<p>Thus we read in Chaucer (Chanouns Yemannes Tale):-- The bodies sevene
eek, <span class="lol">lol</span>! hem heer anoon: Sol gold is, and Luna silver we threpe, Mars
yren, Mercurie quik-silver we clepe, Saturnus leed and Jupiter is tin,
And Venus coper, by my fader kin!</p>

<p>And when I had mounted two steps I turned to look for them, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! I
saw the earth cleave asunder, and there arose from it an Ifrit, a
monster of hideousness, who said to the damsel &quot;What trouble and
posher be this wherewith thou disturbest me?</p>

<p>But if thou shouldst cast it with thy hands, <span class="lol">lol</span>, like a star, it sends
a flaming track through the sky. This I will give thee; and do thou
strike with thy shaft and charm the daughter of Aeetes with love for
Jason; and let there be no loitering.</p>

<p>Thy raiment, with which thou wast covered, hath not decayed for age,
and thy foot is not worn, <span class="lol">lol</span> this is the fortieth year, 8:5. That thou
mayst consider in thy heart, that as a man traineth up his son, so the
Lord thy God hath trained thee up.</p>

<p>So he rose and threw the net and waited a full hour, after which time
he pulled at it and, finding it heavy, handled it gently and drew it
in, little by little, till he got it ashore, when <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! he
saw in it a one-eyed, lame-legged ape.</p>

<p>And now the lists are opened and, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a dazzling band, The Saracens,
on sorrel steeds leap forth upon the sand; Their trailing cloaks are
flashing like the golden orange rind, The hoods of green from their
shoulders hang and flutter in the wind.</p>

<p>Then was I ware, <span class="lol">lol</span>! at the last, As I mine eyen gan upcast, That this
ilke noble queen On her shoulders gan sustene* *sustain Both the

<p>42:8 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was
fifty cubits: and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, before the temple were an hundred cubits. 42:9
And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one
goeth into them from the utter court.</p>

<p>And, as the bright dimensions of the star In heav&#8217;n excelling, as once
here on earth Were, in my eyeballs lively portray&#8217;d, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! from within
the sky a cresset fell, Circling in fashion of a diadem, And girt the
star, and hov&#8217;ring round it wheel&#8217;d.</p>

<p>that is mine intent,&#8220; Quoth he to me; &#8221;therefore I dwell;* *tarry But,

*unless Thou shalt never *can begin* *be able* To come into it, out of
doubt, So fast it whirleth, <span class="lol">lol</span>! about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon as I reached the level plain, My dogs found out the scent amain;
My frightened horse soon reared on high,-- His fear I could not
pacify, For, coiled up in a circle, <span class="lol">lol</span>! There lay the fierce and
hideous foe, Sunning himself upon the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>1:6 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon
mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the
chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. 1:7 And when he looked
behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.</p>

<p>29:9 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and
our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 29:10 Now it is
in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his
fierce wrath may turn away from us.</p>

<p>And of his song nought only the sentence, As writ myn autour called

<p>Soon as we had quitted them, Advancing onward, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a voice that seem&#8217;d
Like vollied light&#8217;ning, when it rives the air, Met us, and shouted,
&#8220;Whosoever finds Will slay me,&#8221; then fled from us, as the bolt Lanc&#8217;d
sudden from a downward-rushing cloud.</p>

<p>And ere he finished speaking, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the two other Princes
came in and when they looked upon his condition and noted the state of
prosperity he was in, surrounded as he was by all manner of weal, they
felt only increase of envy and malice.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, we have now lost the service of Karaz! for though I utter ten
spells and one spell in a breath, the Horse Garraveen will ere that

free to do his ill deeds and plot against us.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an
unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under
the plane-tree in the garden! Even when there were sounds of sorrow
among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, see ye there now,&#8221; quoth Prior Vincent. &#8220;Here ye have a knight
with so lean a purse as scarce to buy him a crust of bread to munch,

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, Esther also By counsel good deliver&#8217;d out of woe The people of

<p>IV It ceased, and she thought of whom was need, The friar or the

<p>24:17 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote

<p>14:42 Rise up, let us go; <span class="lol">lol</span>, he that betrayeth me is at hand. 14:43
And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve,
and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief
priests and the scribes and the elders.</p>

<p>This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some
days after, <span class="lol">lol</span>! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again
it was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more
it disappeared as if it had never been.</p>

<p>Bourbon the fair city keeps, in right Of Francis, from the furious

Through these the city shall anew be lost.</p>

<p>_3670 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, Winter comes!--the grief of many graves, The frost of death,
the tempest of the sword, The flood of tyranny, whose sanguine waves
Stagnate like ice at Faith the enchanter&#8217;s word, And bind all human
hearts in its repose abhorred. _3675 24.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> there an Angel who is making haste To come towards us; <span class="lol">lol</span>,
returning is From service of the day the sixth handmaiden. With
reverence thine acts and looks adorn, So that he may delight to speed
us upward; Think that this day will never dawn again.</p>

<p>When it was the Three Hundred and Forty-second Night, She said, It
hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Chief was about to flog
them when <span class="lol">lol</span>! a man broke through the crowd till he came up to the
Chief of Police and the trooper and said; &quot;Ho!</p>

<p>Presently, ere I could be ware, a man plucked the bag from under my
head and ran off with it at speed: whereupon I started up in alarm and
affright and would have arisen to run after him; but <span class="lol">lol</span>! my feet were
found with a rope and I fell on my face.</p>

<p>* *thrive <span class="lol">Lol</span> such a thing &#8217;tis t&#8217;have a tongue loose! Now, pardie:
fool, yet were it bet* for thee *better Have held thy peace, than
show&#8217;d thy nicety;* *foolishness It lies not in his wit, nor in his
will, But sooth is said, a fool cannot be still.</p>

<p>As she spoke, Ralph lifted up his hand and pointed to the window, and
said: &quot;Friends, as we were speaking of all these marvels we were
forgetting the need of Upmeads and the day of battle; and <span class="lol">lol</span> now! how
the dawn is widening and the candles fading.</p>

<p>I still was wondering what so famished them, For the occasion not yet
manifest Of their emaciation and sad squalor; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! from out the
hollow of his head His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;
Then cried aloud: &quot;What grace to me is this?</p>

<p>The broker opened the door of sale at the sum named and, as he was yet
calling, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the Wazir Al-Mu&#8217;ín bin Sáwí passed through the bazar and,
seeing Nur al-Din Ali waiting at one side, said to himself, &quot;Why is
Khákán&#8217;s son[FN#33] standing about here?</p>

<p>The place pleased him; so he sat down there and taking out some dried
fruits he had brought with him, began to eat, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! he espied a
great smoke rising up to heaven and, taking fright, he climbed up into
a tree and hid himself among the branches.</p>

<p>However Zayn al-Asnam took up a pickaxe and, descending to that part
of the palace where his sire lay entombed, began to dig and to delve;
nor had he worked a long while[FN#19] ere, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! there
appeared to him a ring bedded in a marble slab.</p>

<p>and <span class="lol">lol</span>, a fair slave-girl that came to her and stood by with bent
head, like a white lily by a milk-white antelope; so Noorna clouded
her brow a moment, as when the moon darkeneth behind a scud, and
cried, &#8217;Speak! art thou in league with Karaz, girl?</p>

<p>But this insatiate, the commission given By fate exceeds, and tempts
the wrath of heaven: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, how his rage dishonest drags along Hector&#8217;s
dead earth, insensible of wrong! Brave though he be, yet by no reason
awed, He violates the laws of man and god.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> now, we will make trial of the thing. &#8220; So on a time as men sat at
the drink, the king sat down to talk with the women, and said: -- &#8221;In
what wise do ye note the wearing of the hours, whenas night grows old,
if ye may not see the lights of heaven?</p>

<p>All the women looked at their hands, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they were full of blood,
and it flowed down and stained their garments. They said to Zuleika,
&quot;This slave in thy house did enchant us, and we could not turn our
eyes away from him on account of his beauty.</p>

<p>Thus fared it with these; but as regards the case of the Prince of Al-
Irak, his father who owned no issue, or man-child or girl-child, lay
sleeping one night of the nights when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! he heard the
words, &quot;All things befal by Fate and Fortune.</p>

<p>Then the Genie hung still, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! two radiant figures swept toward
the roof he watched, and between them Noorna bin Noorka, her long dark
hair borne far backward, and her robe of silken stuff fluttering and
straining on the pearl buttons as she flew.</p>

<p>For strength is with the holy:- Already I shuddered to feel the wave,
As I kept sinking slowly:- XXX I felt the cold wave and the under-tug
Of the Brides, when--starting and shrinking - <span class="lol">Lol</span>, Adrian tilts the
water-jug! And Bruges with morn is blinking.</p>

<p>But valour stoops at last to numbers; <span class="lol">lol</span>! The king is taken, is
conveyed to Spain; And all upon Pescara&#8217;s lord bestow And him of that
inseparable twain -- Of Guasto hight -- the praise and prime renown
For that great king captived and host o&#8217;erthrown.</p>

<p>And therewithal his hand in his he lay&#8217;th; &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> here my faith, in me
shall be no lack. &#8221; &#8220;Then put thine hand adown right by my back,&#8221;
Saide this man, &quot;and grope well behind, Beneath my buttock, there thou
shalt find A thing, that I have hid in privity.</p>

<p>Now one day of the days Prince Mohammed rode off a-hunting, as was his
wont, when <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! he beheld a fowl with green plumage wheeling
around him in circles and rocketing in the air and seeing this he was
desirous to bring it down with an arrow.</p>

<p>For so the Goddess wrought that no decay, No loathly thing about his
body crept; And all the people look&#8217;d on him and wept, And, weeping,
Paris lit the pine-wood dry, And <span class="lol">lol</span>, a rainy wind arose and swept The
flame and fragrance far into the sky. XLIII.</p>

<p>When he had ended eating the dates he threw away the stones with force
and <span class="lol">lol</span>! an Ifrit appeared, huge of stature and brandishing a drawn
sword, wherewith he approached the mer chant and said, &quot;Stand up that
I may slay thee, even as thou slewest my son!</p>

<p>And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he wist well it was the sword of
the stone, and so he rode to his father Sir Ector, and said: Sir, <span class="lol">lol</span>
here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I must be king of this land.
When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he &lt;9 CH.</p>

<p>Then, as they hastened o&#8217;er the deathly waste, Aiming for Meru, having
thoughts at soul Infinite, eager,--<span class="lol">lol</span>! Draupadi reeled, With faltering
heart and feet; and Bhima turned, Gazing upon her; and that hero spake
To Yudhi-sthira: &quot;Master, Brother, King!</p>

<p>And on Whit-Tuesday, as the king sat at the banquet, <span class="lol">lol</span>, there entered
a tall, fair-headed youth, clad in a coat and surcoat of satin, and a
golden-hilted sword about his neck, and low shoes of leather upon his
feet. And he came and stood before Arthur.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, she wins, and of her harmonies She is full sure! Upon her
dying rose She drops a look of fondness, and goes by, Scarce any
retrospection in her eye; For she the laws of growth most deeply
knows, Whose hands bear, here, a seed-bag--there, an urn.</p>

<p>I saved her from beating, and she hath me bet; I clothed her in grace
and heavenly light; This bloody shirt she hath on me set; For longing
of love yet would I not let; Sweete strokes are these: <span class="lol">lol</span>! I have
loved her ever as I her het Quia amore langueo.</p>

<p>Since thou art dead, <span class="lol">lol</span>! here I prophesy, Sorrow on love hereafter
shall attend: 1136 It shall be waited on with jealousy, Find sweet
beginning, but unsavoury end; Ne&#8217;er settled equally, but high or low;
That all love&#8217;s pleasure shall not match his woe.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, at this tomb my tributary tears I render for my brethren&#8217;s
obsequies; And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy Shed on this
earth for thy return to Rome; O, bless me here with thy victorious
hand, Whose fortunes Rome&#8217;s best citizens applaud! TITUS.</p>

<p>When last the young Orlando parted from you, He left a promise to
return again Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest, Chewing
the food of sweet and bitter fancy, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, what befell! he threw his eye
aside, And, mark, what object did present itself!</p>

<p>Seeing this I marvelled in my mind and <span class="lol">lol</span>! appeared two damsels as
they were moons and came down from an upper story till they stood on
the ground-floor; after which they cut a piece of cloth into twain and
each maiden took one and tucked up her sleeves.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, the wave hissed apart for the path Of the terrible Charioteer,
With the foam and torn features of wrath, Hurled aloft on each arm in
a sheet; And the steeds clove it, rushing at land Like the teeth of
the famished at meat. Then he swept out his hand.</p>

<p>Forth ran Her women: I am lost, she cried, when <span class="lol">lol</span>, Love in the form
of an admiring man Once more in adoration bent the knee, And brought
the faded Pagan to full blow: For which her throne she gave: not we!
XIII - My version, madam, runs not to that end.</p>

<p>2:9 And, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of
the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 2:10 And
the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good
tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> ye all Englishmen, see ye not what a mischief here was! for he that
was the most king and knight of the world, and most loved the
fellowship of noble knights, and by him they were all upholden, now
might not these Englishmen hold them content with him.</p>

<p>I but drove quietly forward in my carriage, and when some hidalgo of
haughty mien would have stayed me, <span class="lol">lol</span>! I showed at the window my
sweetest smile, and these Senors being (with no disrespect to you) the
most gallant gentlemen in the world,--I passed on!</p>

<p>Then <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! a wall amiddlemost the chamber clave asunder, and
there issued forth the cleft a Basilisk[FN#570] resembling a log of
palm-tree, and he was blowing like the storm-blast and his eyes were
as cressets and he came on wriggling and waving.</p>

<p>When <span class="lol">lol</span>! as near upon the hour of dawn, Through the thick vapours Mars
with fiery beam Glares down in west, over the ocean floor; So seem&#8217;d,
what once again I hope to view, A light so swiftly coming through the
sea, No winged course might equal its career.</p>

<p>And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul Of him, but tell it not;
&#8220;and things he told Incredible to those who witness them; Then added:
&#8221;So interpret thou, my son, What hath been told thee.--<span class="lol">Lol</span>! the
ambushment That a few circling seasons hide for thee!</p>

<p>Thinking upon him he spake out among the Immortals: &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span> you now, how
vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us they say comes evil,
whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness of their own
hearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained.</p>

<p>Now as the Caliph Harun al-Rashid heard these words he laughed so
hearty a laugh that he fell backwards and bade the goodwife repeat her
history till he waxed distraught for excess of merriment, when <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold! a Darwaysh suddenly entered the presence.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, at that sight she clapped her hands joyfully, and ran up to the
youth, and peered in his face, exclaiming, &#8217;Great things indeed! and
praise thou the readers of planets, O nephew of the barber, they that
sent thee searching the Event thou art to master.</p>

<p>Then, like a raven on the of night, The wild Cassandra flitted far and
near, Still crying, &#8220;Gather, gather for the fight, And brace the
helmet on, and grasp the spear, For <span class="lol">lol</span>, the legions of the Night are
here! &#8221; So shriek&#8217;d the dreadful prophetess divine.</p>

<p>In the same way the sermon at the Presbyterian church the week after
was on the text &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> what now doeth Abiram in the land of Melchisideck
Kings Eight and Nine? &#8221; and it was perfectly plain that what was meant
was, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, what is Josh Smith doing in Mariposa?</p>

<p>Yet first <span class="lol">lol</span> you, here are some tools that in thine hands shall keep
us from sheer famine: as for me I am no archer; and forsooth no man-

and a quiver of arrows, which he took well pleased.</p>

<p>But <span class="lol">lol</span> thou, here are the newcomers to hand! &quot; So it was as he said,
and presently the whole band came before them, and they were all of
the Dry Tree, stout men and well weaponed, and they had ridden
exceeding fast, so that their horses were somewhat spent.</p>

<p>But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish <span class="lol">Lol</span> Statius here; and him
I call and pray He now will be the healer of thy wounds. &#8220; &#8221;If I
unfold to him the eternal vengeance,&#8220; Responded Statius, &#8221;where thou
present art, Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.</p>

<p>and the King answered, &#8220;Men tell me thou art a spy sent hither with
intent to slay me; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! I will kill thee ere I be killed by thee;&#8221;
then he called to his Sworder, and said, &quot;Strike me off the head of
this traitor and deliver us from his evil practices.</p>

<p>Knowing the amount of this to be that he did not sell it, but was
willing to receive a present, we gave him ten or twelve reals, which
he pocketed with admirable nonchalance, saying, &#8220;Dios se <span class="lol">lol</span> pague. &#8221;
Taking leave of him, we rode out to the Indians&#8217; huts.</p>

<p>To make me a wicked wight,&#8220; quoth she, &#8221;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, he dissimuleth* here in

<p>And the youths arose and led Shibli Bagarag to a hall of ebony, and
seated him on the upper seat, themselves standing about him; and <span class="lol">lol</span>!
asses and monkeys came before him, complaining of the injustice of men
and their fellows, in brays and bellows and hoots.</p>

<p>4:26 I beheld, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all
the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and
by his fierce anger. 4:27 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land
shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.</p>

<p>And when he presented himself before them with our signs, <span class="lol">lol</span>! they
laughed at them, Though we shewed them no sign that was not greater
than its fellow:12 and therefore did we lay hold on them with
chastisement, to the intent that they might be turned to God.</p>

<p>My Milla an&#8217; me was married when we&#8217;s chillen, an&#8217; we&#8217;s had a good

<p>276 Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps, With gentle majesty

the eye 281 Of the fair breeder that is standing by.</p>

<p>; and he answered &quot;I came here yesternight for a call of nature and to
do what none can do for me, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! a mouse came out of the water,

buffalo, and spoke to me words that entered my ears.</p>

<p>I, too, have hoped from their good looks, And fables of their Northman

where they are driven they go. XLI Good health, my friend!</p>

<p>You shall finde in the Regiment of the Spinij, one Captaine Spurio his

<p>We passed along, athwart the twilight peering Forward as far as ever
eye could stretch Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! by
slow degrees a smoke approached In our direction, sombre as the night,
Nor was there place to hide one&#8217;s self therefrom.</p>

<p>Their conduct was afterwards censured by the twelfth canon of the
Council of Nice; if this particular application may be received,

<p>Thro&#8217; the flaming mountain gorges <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the River leaps the plain; Like
a wild god-stridden courser, Tossing high its foamy mane. Then he

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, He slumbers in His manger, Where the horned oxen fed: Peace, my

groans and endless crying, That thy blest Redeemer came.</p>

<p>It cannot be, some villaines of my Court Are of consent and sufferance

They found the bed vntreasur&#8217;d of their Mistris 2.Lor.</p>

<p>Therewith Gharib crave at him and there befel between them a battle
such as would make a new-born child turn grey and melt the flinty rock

<p>Hereupon he and the man arose and went till they came to the palace of
the Sultan, where they craved leave to enter, but were forbidden by
the Chamberlain, when <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the Princess looked out from the

<p>Then a force, as from Heaven, descends on him there, And lightning

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I teach you the Superman: he is that lightning, he is that

<p>And the dove came in to him in the evening, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, in her mouth was

the dove, which returned not again unto him any more.</p>

<p>When ended was night&#8217;s darkness, and the Dawn Rose from the world&#8217;s

<p>They fared on all that night till the morning morrowed when <span class="lol">lol</span>! they

<p>And at dawntide, O my lord the Sultan, I left the house and went to my

<p>But soon the voice of men on the sea-sand Came round him; and he

laid a shaft of woe, And drew it to the point, and aim&#8217;d it well.</p>

<p>Altherfirst, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there I sigh* *saw Upon a pillar stand on high, That

<p>Then Shibli Bagarag gave thanks to the Prophet, and praised the hawk,
but the hawk darted out of the cabin, and he followed it on deck, and,

<p>And when they had forgotten their warnings, we set open to them the
gates of all things, until, as they were rejoicing in our gifts, we
suddenly laid hold upon them, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they were plunged into despair,
And the uttermost part of that impious people was cut off.</p>

<p>When day broke, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! on the rocks the Istrians; while the sea Swarmed

<p>But when the gray hairs began to appear-- <span class="lol">Lol</span>! a new generation of

<p>He pointed to the windows of the hall therewith, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they grew

him on the back and the other struck him with the sword he held in his
hand and lopped off his head, and he dropped down dead.</p>

<p>He travelled all the boundaries first, and failed; then he made a path
into the desert, and went on and on--and in the heart of the waste
there was an island of green very beautiful to see; and in the heart
of the island, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a herd of camels, and another of horses!</p>

<p>And when the Sompnour heard the Friar gale,* *speak &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>,&#8221; quoth this

<p>White as that Thessalian lily, Fairest Tempe&#8217;s fairest flower, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the
tall Peneian virgin Stands beneath her bathing bower. There the
laurell&#8217;d wreaths o&#8217;erarching Crown&#8217;d the dainty shuddering maid;
There the dark prophetic laurel Kiss&#8217;d her with its sister shade.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, where yon sails their canvas wings extend, All comfortless he
sits, and wails his friend: Ere thirst and want his forces have
oppress&#8217;d, Haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast. &quot; He spoke; and
sudden, at the word of Jove, Shot the descending goddess from above.</p>

<p>They heard and knelt: And Patrick knelt between them; and these three
Upheaved a wondrous strength of prayer; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! All pale, yet shining,
rose the child, and sat, Lifting small hands, and preached to those
around, And straightway they believed, and were baptized.</p>

<p>The kings, with their officers and people, were all very sad and
distressed, supposing that the sandal-wood image had been burned; but
<span class="lol">lol</span>! after four or five days, when the door of a small vihara on the
east was opened, there was immediately seen the original image.</p>

<p>The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm, And <span class="lol">lol</span>! I lie between
that sun and thee: The heat I have from thence doth little harm, Thine
eye darts forth the fire that burneth me; 196 And were I not immortal,
life were done Between this heavenly and earthly sun.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here the wretched Agamemnon stands, The unhappy general of the
Grecian bands, Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend, And woes,
that only with his life shall end! Scarce can my knees these trembling
limbs sustain, And scarce my heart support its load of pain.</p>

<p>But he said again: Rightly is his name called Jacob; for he hath
supplanted me <span class="lol">lol</span> this second time: My birthright he took away before,
and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing. And again he
said to his father: Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing?</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I had this day at dawn intelligence from recreant Oolb, and its
King and Court, and of their return to do honour to Shagpat! And I had
this day at dawn tidings, O people, from Shiraz, and of the adhesion
of that vain city and its provinces to the might of Shagpat!</p>

<p>40:7 Then said I, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I come: in the volume of the book it is written
of me, 40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within
my heart. 40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great
congregation: <span class="lol">lol</span>, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</p>

<p>Now, good my liege, Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman: The love
I bore your queen,--<span class="lol">lol</span>, fool again!-- I&#8217;ll speak of her no more, nor
of your children; I&#8217;ll not remember you of my own lord, Who is lost
too: take your patience to you, And I&#8217;ll say nothing. LEONTES.</p>

<p>For after three days his son will die untimely, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the old man
desires to make away with him foully. &quot; Solomon delayed his verdict
for several days, and when after five days he summoned the old father
to his presence, it appeared that Ornias had spoken the truth.</p>

<p>15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, <span class="lol">lol</span>,
one born in my house is mine heir. 15:4 And, behold, the word of the
LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that
shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</p>

<p>1:6 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation,
which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the
dwellingplaces that are not their&#8217;s. 1:7 They are terrible and
dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of
themselves.</p>

<p>28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 28:20
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:
and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</p>

<p>At midnight by the side of Patrick stood Victor, God&#8217;s Angel, saying,
&quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! thy work Hath favour found and thou ere long shalt die: Thus
therefore saith the Lord, &#8217;So long as sea Girdeth this isle, so long
thy name shall hang In splendour o&#8217;er it, like the stars of God.</p>

<p>My slow steps had already borne me o&#8217;er Such space within the antique
wood, that I Perceived not where I entered any more,-- When, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a
stream whose little waves went by, _25 Bending towards the left
through grass that grew Upon its bank, impeded suddenly My going on.</p>

<p>Such was the case with Al-Ghazban; but as regards Abrizah, she gave
birth to a son, like the moon, and Marjanah took the babe and did him
the necessary offices and laid him by his mother&#8217;s side; and <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold! the child fastened to its mother&#8217;s breast and she dying.</p>

<p>Thereupon he returned to Tarabulus, but as he drew near thereto he was
met outside the city by a bevy of small boys who were playing at
forfeits, and <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! cried one to his comrades, &quot;O lads, do ye
remember such and such a year when our Kazi was brought to bed?</p>

<p>Yet, pardee, god shal helpe us at the laste; And dredelees, if that my

<p>Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone Of one, his fellow-
spirit, and his jaws Expanding, cried: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! this is he I wot of; He
speaks not for himself: the outcast this Who overwhelm&#8217;d the doubt in
Caesar&#8217;s mind, Affirming that delay to men prepar&#8217;d Was ever harmful.</p>

<p>A minute ago and we could see the fire, and the tree, and men and
horses about them: and now, <span class="lol">lol</span> you! there is naught save two great
grey stones lying on the grass, and a man&#8217;s bare bones leaning up
against the tree, and a ruckle of old horse-bones on either side of
him.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, these things are said in part of his ways: and seeing we have
heard scarce a little drop of his word, who shall be able to behold
the thunder of his greatness? Job Chapter 27 Job persists in asserting
his own innocence, and that hypocrites will be punished in the end.</p>

<p>He put it on and sat as before, till the cup came round to him, when
he struck the gong a second time and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a door opened and out of it
came a eunuch with a chair of gold, followed by a damsel fairer than
the first, bearing a lute, such as would strike the envious mute.</p>

<p>With that she gan hir eiyen doun to caste, And Pandarus to coghe gan a

<p>While now I stood Wond&#8217;ring what thus could waste them (for the cause
Of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind Appear&#8217;d not) <span class="lol">lol</span>! a spirit
turn&#8217;d his eyes In their deep-sunken cell, and fasten&#8217;d then On me,
then cried with vehemence aloud: &quot;What grace is this vouchsaf&#8217;d me?</p>

<p>So King Badr Basim knew that the old woman was Queen Lab&#8217;s mother and
that he had been tricked and would have fled; when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the old woman
whistled a loud whistle and her call was obeyed by an Ifrit as he were
a great mountain, whereat Badr was affrighted and stood still.</p>

<p>So while the January pastoral tells of the unhappy love of Colin Clout
(Spenser) for Rosalind, the springtime of April calls for a song in
praise of Elizabeth: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, how finely the Graces can it foot To the
instrument! They dancen deffly and singen soote, In their merriment.</p>

<p>A feeble groan I heard, his breast was pierced by that dire arrow
keen: All trembling to the spot I pressed, <span class="lol">lol</span> there thy hermit boy was
seen. Flew to the sound my arrow, meant the wandering elephant to
slay, Toward the river brink it went,--and there thy son expiring lay.</p>

<p>And I beheld, and <span class="lol">lol</span> a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair
of balances in his hand. 6:6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the
four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of
barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</p>

<p>Trewe is thy sentence, That litel witen folk what is to yerne That

<p>&lt;160&gt; Then a knight named Sir Gainus, nigh cousin to the emperor,
said, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, how these Britons be full of pride and boast, and they brag
as though they bare up all the world. Then Sir Gawaine was sore
grieved with these words, and pulled out his sword and smote off his
head.</p>

<p>40:17 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, there were
chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty
chambers were upon the pavement. 40:18 And the pavement by the side of
the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.</p>

<p>Then shall many a one say when he sees thee shedding tears: &#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, this
is the wife of Hector who was the best warrior of the Trojans when
they fought for their town. &#8217; Thus will they speak and thou shalt have
new sorrow for lack of such a man to drive away the day of slavery.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, where he sits, the lechour, in the tree. Now will I granten, of my

knowen all her harlotry, Both in reproof of her and other mo&#8217;.</p>

<p>Now, at these words the fox-heads and the sheep-heads and the ass-
heads and the other heads of beasts were lifted up, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they put
their hands to their ears, and tapped their foreheads with the finger
of reflection, as creatures seeking to bring to mind a serious matter.</p>

<p>and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I
am gone forth, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the prince of Grecia shall come. 10:21 But I will
shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is
none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</p>

<p>By Allah, come ye forth to me, for <span class="lol">lol</span>, I&#8217;m come to you I May he who&#8217;s

there sallied forth to him Zuheir ben Hebib, and they wheeled about
and feinted awhile, then came to dose quarters and exchanged strokes.</p>

<p>His testy master goeth about to take him; When <span class="lol">lol</span>! the unback&#8217;d
breeder, full of fear, 320 Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake
him, With her the horse, and left Adonis there: As they were mad, unto
the wood they hie them, Outstripping crows that strive to overfly
them.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, said Sir Dinadan, here may a man prove, be a man never so good yet
may he have a fall, and he was never so wise but he might be overseen,
and he rideth well that never fell. So Sir Tristram was passing wroth,
and said to Sir Persides and to Sir Dinadan: I will revenge me.</p>

<p>So they untethered the beasts and began to drive them out; and Sabbah
came down to Kanmakan with loud voicing and hugely rejoicing; when <span class="lol">lol</span>!
there arose a cloud of dust and grew till it walled the view, and
there appeared under of it riders an hundred, like lions an-hungered.</p>

<p>So they advanced beyond him, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the Cave of Chrysolites irradiate
with beams, breaks of brilliance, confluences of lively hues, restless
rays, meeting, vanishing, flooding splendours, now scattered in
dazzling joints and spars, now uniting in momentary disks of radiance.</p>

<p>14:40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the
top of the mountain, saying, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, we be here, and will go up unto the
place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. 14:41 And
Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the
LORD?</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> how straight up to heaven he holds them rear&#8217;d, Winnowing the air

<p>Thereupon the twain threaded through the crowd and locked at the
portals of the palace, and it was opened to them and they entered, and
<span class="lol">lol</span>! the hand that opened the portals was the hand of a slave of the
Sword, and against corners of the Court leaned slaves silly with
slumber.</p>

<p>It can be compared with nothing less than the effect produced by the
publication of the _Nouvelle Hé<span class="lol">lol</span>ïse_. At last the Hebrew language had
found the master who could make the appeal to popular taste, who
understood the art of speaking to the multitude and touching them
deeply.</p>

<p>Without it, proud Versailles, thy glory falls; And Nero&#8217;s terraces
desert their walls: The vast parterres a thousand hands shall make;
<span class="lol">Lol</span>! Cobham comes, and floats them with a lake: Or cut wide views
through mountains to the plain, You&#8217;ll wish your hill or sheltered
seat again.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, as frogs that Winter cumbers Meet the Spring with stiffen&#8217;d yawn,
We from our hard night of slumbers Marched into the bloody dawn. XI
Day on day we fought, though shattered: Pushed and met repulses sharp,
Till our Raven&#8217;s plumes were scattered: All, save old Aneurin&#8217;s harp.</p>

<p>Here was thy father&#8217;s bed, here in my breast; Thou art the next of

not be one minute in an hour Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love&#8217;s

<p>The Sun not yet thy sighes, from heauen cleares, Thy old grones yet
ringing in my auncient eares: <span class="lol">Lol</span> here vpon thy cheeke the staine doth

<p>And the priest said: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, here is the sword of Goliath, the Philistine,
whom thou slewest in the valley of Terebinth, wrapped up in a cloth
behind the ephod: if thou wilt take this, take it, for here there is
no other but this. And David said: There is none like that, give it

<p>No sooner had the goddess ceas&#8217;d to speak, When, <span class="lol">lol</span>! th&#8217; obedient

beauteous maids the billows sweep, As rode before tall vessels on the

<p>And I to be your very humble, true, Secret, and in my paines patient,

<p>From thence forth he rideth up and down, And ev&#8217;ry thing came him to

<p>17:1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said
to Nathan the prophet, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark
of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains. 17:2 Then Nathan
said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.</p>

<p>5:15 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel,
saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a
nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what
they say. 5:16 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all
mighty men.</p>

<p>Mordecai understood that these signs meant a locality by the name of
Gagot-Zerifim, Cottage-Roofs, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, new grain was found there for
the &#8217;Omer offering. On another occasion a deaf mute pointed with one
hand to his eye and with the other to the staple of the bolt on the
door.</p>

<p>Scarce had he spoke, when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the chiefs appear, And spring to earth;
the Greeks dismiss their fear: With words of friendship and extended
hands They greet the kings; and Nestor first demands: &quot;Say thou, whose
praises all our host proclaim, Thou living glory of the Grecian name!</p>

<p>Then the Saint Upraised his head; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! in snowy sheen Cresting high
rock, and ridge, and airy peak, Innumerable the Sons of God all round
Vested the invisible mountain with white light, As when the foam-white
birds of ocean throng Sea-rock so close that none that rock may see.</p>

<p>And with that he fell to pacing the floor with long, thoughtful
strides as the idiot&#8217;s voice cried in quavering accents: &#8220;O <span class="lol">Lol</span>-ord,
have me-ercy upon us! &#8221; **************************** Thus the winsome
Nilushka proved indispensable to the foul, mean, unhealthy life of the
suburb.</p>

<p>Now whilst pondering this matter, <span class="lol">lol</span>! I heard a sound of a band of
drums beating; whereat I was afraid and hid myself for a while: then,
looking out through a crevice, I saw damsels, like moons, come walking
through the market, two by two, with uncovered heads and faces
displayed.</p>

<p>As I best might, I hid from him my sorrow, And took him by the hand,
Saint John to borrow,* *witness, pledge And said him thus; &#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, I am

answer&#8217;d, it needs not to rehearse; Who can say bet* than he, who can

<p>Then the eyes of the Chief reddened, his nostrils grew wide, and the
darkness of his face was as flame mixed with smoke, and he seized
Bhanavar and hastened onward, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! yonder were his men overmatched,
and warriors of the mountains bursting on them from an ambush on all
sides.</p>

<p>V I held the village lily cheap, And the dream around her idle: <span class="lol">Lol</span>,
quietly as I lay to sleep, The bells led me off to a bridal. VI My
bride wore the hood of a Beguine, And mine was the foot to falter;
Three cowled monks, rat-eyed, were seen; The Cross was of bones o&#8217;er
the altar.</p>

<p>Then Kullervo journeyed onward, Calling war upon his bugle, Till a
messenger appearing, Brought this word to Kullerwoinen: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! thy
brother too has perished, Dead he lies within the forest, Manalainen&#8217;s
trumpet called him; Home return and do him honor, Lay him in the lap

<p>9:9 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among
all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the
least grain fall upon the earth. 9:10 All the sinners of my people
shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor
prevent us.</p>

<p>10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
therein; which are offered by the law; 10:9 Then said he, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I come
to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish
the second.</p>

<p>They went out together and Redhead said softly: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> thou that doddered
oak yonder; like a piece of a hay-rick it looks under the stars; if
thou seest it, come in again at once. &#8221; Ralph turned and drew Redhead
in, and said when they were in the tent again: &quot;Yea, I saw it: what
then?</p>

<p>The Sultan of China looked at him and considered him carefully and <span class="lol">lol</span>
and behold! he was an ancient man, past his ninetieth year; swart of
face, white of beard, and hoar of eyebrows; lop eared and proboscis-
nosed,[FN#696] with a vacant, silly and conceited expression of
countenance.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, and behold, Sentaro was awakened by his own screams, to find that
during his long prayer he had fallen asleep before the shrine, and
that all his extraordinary and frightful adventures had been only a
wild dream. He was in a cold perspiration with fright, and utterly
bewildered.</p>

<p>26:47 And while he yet spake, <span class="lol">lol</span>, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and
with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief
priests and elders of the people. 26:48 Now he that betrayed him gave
them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold
him fast.</p>

<p>28:7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the
dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye
see him: <span class="lol">lol</span>, I have told you. 28:8 And they departed quickly from the
sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples
word.</p>

<p>So she wept for his absence, and estrangement and she began repeating,
&quot;O ye who fled and left my heart in pain low li&#8217;en, * No breath of

complains of wake, but <span class="lol">lol</span>! * Tears occupy it would that wake content
these eyne!</p>

<p>She then disappeared for two days, when she again came and knocked at
the door; so I went out to her, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! hunger had taken away her
voice; but, after a rest she said, &#8217;O my brother, I am worn out with
want and know not what to do, for I cannot show my face to any man but
to thee.</p>

<p>So they went up to it and one of the men gave it a kick, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! it
was a thing of human semblance, long of eyes and cloven of head and
hidden under one of his ears, for he was wont, whenas he lay down to
sleep, to spread on ear under his head, and cover his face with the
other ear.</p>

<p>For <span class="lol">lol</span>, O Lord, my King and my God, for Thy service be whatever useful

<p>23:6 And he returned unto him, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he stood by his burnt
sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab. 23:7 And he took up his
parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram,
out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and
come, defy Israel.</p>

<p>Whereby I shall go see thy ship ride on the strand, And think and say

<p>So he sat with them under the low branches of the tree; and they

And <span class="lol">lol</span>! the abyss--and thither am I moving-- I have no power within me

<p>Then, <span class="lol">lol</span>! at dead of night I heard a mystic voice, till then unheard,

<p>And he that travelled to the End hath told that when the thunder was

<p>The two men then held a short consultation, at the close of which they

<p>They spake, and said to one another: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, the sight that we saw last

should this thing become known to him in the latter days, he will say
to us, Why did you conceal this matter from me? and then we shall all

<p>So saying, he rose and broke the padlocks and opening the door saw a
narrow passage, which he followed for some three hours when <span class="lol">lol</span>! he
came out on the shore of a vast ocean[FN#196] and fared on along the

Queen Lab, in great state, and seeing King Badr Basim sitting in the

loveliness and became passionately enamoured of him, and distraught

<p>His heart with gratitude was filled, his bosom filled with pride, And
with doffed bonnet, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he bowed and once again he cried: &#8220;And,
Fortune, do thy worst; it is not meant, By Allah, that his knight
should die in banishment. &#8221; They led him to the warden&#8217;s house, and

<p>So within two hours she brought the Lady Ettard thither, and both

<p>So she brought it and he threw the whole lock upon the fire As soon as
the odour of the burning hair dispread itself, the palace shook and
trembled, and all present heard a rumbling and rolling of thunder and
a noise as of wings and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the Jinniyah who had been a serpent stood
in the Caliph&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>So I buried them in the ground and, buying two farthings&#8217; worth of
bread and &#8216;kitchen,&#8217;[FN#184] seated me at the door and broke my fast;
after which I sat pondering my case and continued so doing till the
time of afternoon, prayer, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! a slave-girl accosted me saying,
&#8217;My mistress calleth for thee.</p>

<p>And Iris heard, and swift She darted, through cloud-billows plunging
down -- Thou hadst said: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, in the sky dark water and fire! &#8221; And to
Aeolia came she, isle of caves, Of echoing dungeons of mad-raging
winds With rugged ribs of mountain overarched, Whereby the mansion
stands of Aeolus Hippotas&#8217; son.</p>

<p>But the King of the City of Shagpat was wroth, and commanded his
guards to flourish their scimitars, and the keen light cut the chords
of indecision in Baba Mustapha, and drove him upon Shagpat with a dash
of desperation; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he stretched his hand and brought down the
blade upon the head of Shagpat.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, you look at Flow and Drought Interflashed and interwrought: Ended

Mirrored pants the Life, the Death; Each of either reaped and sown:
Rosiest rosy wanes to crone.</p>

<p>Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves And barren chasms, and all to
left and right The bare black cliff clanged round him, as he based His
feet on juts of slippery crag that rang Sharp-smitten with the dint of
armed heels-- And on a sudden, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the level lake, And the long

<p>Now wound the path its dizzy ledge Around a precipice&#8217;s edge, When <span class="lol">lol</span>!
a wasted female form, Blighted by wrath of sun and storm, In tattered
weeds and wild array, Stood on a cliff beside the way, And glancing
round her restless eye, Upon the wood, the rock, the sky, Seemed
naught to mark, yet all to spy.</p>

<p>They beginne to smoake mee, and disgraces haue of late, knock&#8217;d too

Threading thickets, mounting glades, Up the verdurous colonnades,

<p>Ralph lighted down from his horse, and met the man, who was coming

<p>16:11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they are

<p>40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: <span class="lol">lol</span>, I

<p>The farmer took from her hand the well-worn copy of Euclid&#8217;s

whosoever shall produce the sides, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the same also shall be equal

<p>Now as they stood and beheld it, the Sage spake: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span> ye, my children,

<p>So, he thinks, the drama is ended; but after he and his noisy
followers have departed to slumber, <span class="lol">lol</span>! enter once more Puck, Oberon,
Titania and the whole train of fairies, to repeople the ancient world
and dance to the music of Mendelssohn: Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
While we sing, and bless this place.</p>

<p>You are up beside her at a sniff of that wine.--And <span class="lol">lol</span>, venerable
Drury! we duck through the court, reminded a bit by our feelings of
our first love, who hadn&#8217;t the cleanest of faces or nicest of manners,
but she takes her station in memory because we were boys then, and the
golden halo of youth is upon her.</p>

<p>VII <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the herb of healing, when once the herb is known, Shines in

pomegranates tumble and burst hard rind.</p>

<p>Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old softy, expecting I&#8217;m

<p>There Zornadhu lives in his garden of poppies with Sidono standing

athwart the valley sways the heads of the tall poppies against the
Temple wall, the old prophet says: &quot;The flowers are all praying, and
<span class="lol">lol</span>! they be nearer to the gods than men.</p>

<p>It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the third old man
told a tale to the Jinni more wondrous than the two preceding, the
Jinni mar veiled with exceeding marvel, and, shaking with delight,
cried, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! I have given thee the remainder of the merchant&#8217;s

<p>Thus far concerning him; but as regards Ahmad al-Danaf, Ala al-Din&#8217;s
adopted father, he was sitting making merry with his followers in a
garden, and carousing and pleasuring when <span class="lol">lol</span>! in came one of the
water-carriers of the Divan and, kissing the hand of Ahmad al-Danaf,
said to him, &quot;O Captain Ahmad, O Danaf!</p>

<p>Thereupon the Prince trilled the pin and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the horse forthwith
soared with him high in ether, as it were a bird, and gave not
overflying till it disappeared from men&#8217;s espying, whereat the King
was troubled and perplexed about his case and said to the Persian, &quot;O
sage, look how thou mayest make him descend.</p>

<p>Father Maguire, entitled to all praise and gratitude for his untiring

<p>Therewith he lighted down and she in likewise: then he took her by the
hand and led her on a few yards, and said: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, beloved, this quicken-
tree; hereby it was that the tent was pitched wherein I lay the night
when I was taken. &#8221; She looked on him shyly and said: &quot;Wilt thou not
sleep here once more to-night?</p>

<p>After this I beheld in the vision of the night, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, a fourth
beast, terrible and wonderful, and exceeding strong, it had great iron
teeth, eating and breaking in pieces, and treading down the rest with
his feet: and it was unlike to the other beasts which I had seen
before it, and had ten horns. Ten horns.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thou art,&#8217; quoth she, &#8217;a sea, a sovereign king; And, <span class="lol">lol</span>, there falls

Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood. If all these petty ills
shall change thy good, Thy sea within a puddle&#8217;s womb is hears&#8217;d, And
not the puddle in thy sea dispers&#8217;d.</p>

<p>He stood gazing at them from afar as they entered the pavilion and
perched on the couch; after which each bird rent open its neck-skin
with its claws and issued out of it; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was but a garment of
feathers, and there came forth therefrom ten virgins, maids whose
beauty shamed the brilliancy of the moon.</p>

<p>With feeble pace, And settled sorrow on his aged face, Fast as he
could, he sighing quits the walls; And thus descending, on the guards
he calls: &quot;You to whose care our city-gates belong, Set wide your
portals to the flying throng: For <span class="lol">lol</span>! he comes, with unresisted sway;
He comes, and desolation marks his way!</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye may be right, Robin,&#8221; replied the Bailie, after a moment&#8217;s
reflection; &#8220;he was a considerate man the deacon; he ken&#8217;d we had a&#8217;
our frailties, and he <span class="lol">lol</span>&#8217;ed his friends--Ye&#8217;ll no hae forgotten him,
Robin? &#8221; This question he put in a softened tone, conveying as much at
least of the ludicrous as the pathetic.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, in my heart the heat of every heart burns high And in mine eyes
unite the tears of every eye. When she had made an end of her song,
she wept till she made the bystanders weep and the Lady Zubeideh
condoled with her and said to her, &quot;God on thee, O Sitt el Milah, sing
us somewhat, so we may hearken to thee.</p>

<p>But it &#8216;peared like I felt stronger in de <span class="lol">Lol</span>&#8216;d, an&#8217; I give de same

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here in one line is his name twice writ: &#8216;Poor forlorn Proteus,

Thus will I fold them one upon another: Now kiss, embrace, contend, do

<p>Then he crept down stealthily and, finding the eunuch asleep, as of
wont, raised the curtain and went on little by little, till he came to
the door of the Princess&#8217;s alcove-[FN#21]chamber and stopped to
listen; when <span class="lol">lol</span>! he heard her shedding plenteous tears and reciting
verses, whilst her women slept round her.</p>

<p>Awaken therefore that gentle passion in every swain: for <span class="lol">lol</span>! adorned
with all the charms in which nature can array her; bedecked with
beauty, youth, sprightliness, innocence, modesty, and tenderness,
breathing sweetness from her rosy lips, and darting brightness from
her sparkling eyes, the lovely Sophia comes!</p>

<p>27:23 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
and whom I serve, 27:24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought
before Caesar: and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, God hath given thee all them that sail with
thee. 27:25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that
it shall be even as it was told me.</p>

<p>70 Say to your sons,--<span class="lol">Lol</span>, here his grave, Who victor died on Gadite
wave; To him, as to the burning levin, Short, bright, resistless
course was given. Where&#8217;er his country&#8217;s foes were found, 75 Was heard
the fated thunder&#8217;s sound, Till burst the bolt on yonder shore,
Roll&#8217;d, blazed, destroyed,--and was no more.</p>

<p>26:2] {400} Now I saw in my dream that these two men went in at the
gate: and <span class="lol">lol</span>, as they entered, they were transfigured, and they had
raiment put on that shone like gold. There was also that met them with
harps and crowns, and gave them to them -- the harps to praise withal,
and the crowns in token of honour.</p>

<p>In a few minutes I saw a body of them enter the coffee-house marching
arm in arm, two by two, stamping on the ground with their feet in a
kind of measure, and repeating in loud chorus as they walked round the
spacious apartment, the following grisly stanza:- &quot;Que es <span class="lol">lol</span> que abaja
Por aquel cerro? Ta ra ra ra ra.</p>

<p>I supposed that he had only hit upon some new &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, here! &#8221; when to my
relief, he told me that he had concluded that no system which should
go perfectly upon all fours was possible, inasmuch as no one could get

<p>BEOWULF Translated by Gummere BEOWULF PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE
DANISH HOUSE <span class="lol">LOL</span>, praise of the prowess of people-kings of spear-armed

<p>&lt;9&gt; <span class="lol">Lol</span>, how that drunken Lot unkindely* *unnaturally Lay by his

<p>&lt;23&gt; For of her owen thought she wax&#8217;d all red, Rememb&#8217;ring her right

<p>What happened in consequence of this hospital work for those whom she
considered her enemies, is thus related by Mrs. Morris: &quot;I thought I
had received all my pay when they thankfully acknowledged all my
kindness, but <span class="lol">lol</span>! in a short time afterwards, a very rough, ill-
looking man came to the door and asked for me.</p>

<p>He is there in midst of the pupils he harried to brains awake, trod
into union; <span class="lol">lol</span>, These are his Epic&#8217;s tutored Dardans, yon that
Rhapsode&#8217;s Achaeans to know. Nor is aught of an equipollent conflict
seen, nor the weaker&#8217;s flashed device; Headless is offered a breast to
beaks deliberate, formal, assured, precise.</p>

<p>68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the
Lord; Selah: 68:33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens,
which were of old; <span class="lol">lol</span>, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty
voice. 68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over
Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.</p>

<p>The &#8216;Periplus&#8217; of Hanno, a few coins, a score of lines in Plautus,
and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, all that remains of the Carthaginian world! &quot;Many generations
must needs pass away before the struggle between the two races could
be renewed; and the Arabs, that formidable rear-guard of the Semitic
world, dashed forth from their deserts.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> now,&#8220; answered the lady, &#8221;once again I will not vex or disobey you;
but be sure that you so order matters that he refrain from further
annoyance, as I give you my word that never will I have recourse to
you again touching this matter. &quot; Then, without another word, and with
a troubled air, she took leave of him.</p>

<p>and <span class="lol">lol</span> you, I will show the Champions of the Dry Tree the way into
their own hall and high place. &quot; Therewith he thrust the door open,
for it was not locked, and strode into the hall, still leading Ursula
by the hand, and all the company followed him, the clash of their
armour resounding through the huge building.</p>

<p>But as I looked Toward them, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a serpent with six feet Springs forth
on one, and fastens full upon him: His midmost grasp&#8217;d the belly, a
forefoot Seiz&#8217;d on each arm (while deep in either cheek He flesh&#8217;d his
fangs); the hinder on the thighs Were spread, &#8217;twixt which the tail
inserted curl&#8217;d Upon the reins behind.</p>

<p>And as they were speaking, suddenly the world was turned topsy-
turvy,[FN#308] and dust-clouds and sand-devils[FN#309] flew around and
whirlwinds began to play about them, and <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the monster
made his appearance; and as he approached he was lashing his flanks
with his tail like the sound of a kettle-drum.</p>

<p>As they sat looking on the garden <span class="lol">lol</span>! the Caliph appeared escorted by
near an hundred eunuchs, with drawn swords in hand and girt about with
a score of damsels, as they were moons, all clad in the richest of
raiment and on each one&#8217;s head was a crown set with jewels and rubies;
while each carried a lighted flambeau.</p>

<p>They made for this, and stayed not in their course till they drew near
thereto, when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was a high castle, firm of foundations and great
and gruesome, as it were a towering mountain, builded all of black
stone, with frowning crenelles and a door of gleaming China steel,
that dazzled the eyes and dazed the wits.</p>

<p>So the folk armed themselves cap-à-pie and waited till the noon of
Night, when they dispersed about the enemy&#8217;s camp and tarried awhile
when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! Jamrkan smote shield with sword and shouted,
&#8220;Allaho Akbar&#8217;&#8221; Thereupon they all cried out the like, till rang again
valley and mountain, hills, sands and ruins.</p>

<p>But when this peaceful conventicle had for some time been listening
silently, devoutly, and admiringly, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they were startled by a
stentorian voice bawling into the room the words:--&#8220;Gentlemen, the
horses are put in. &#8221; The postmaster, who was indignant at this
untimely interruption, begged the musician to continue.</p>

<p>10:13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
twenty days: but, <span class="lol">lol</span>, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help
me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. 10:14 Now I am come
to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter
days: for yet the vision is for many days.</p>

<p>XI Adorned with scarlet hat, and scarlet pall, His nephew Benedict,
<span class="lol">lol</span>! there I see; With him Campeggio and Mantua&#8217;s cardinal; Glory and
light of the consistory; And (if I dote not) mark how one and all In
face and gesture show such mighty glee At my return, no easy task
&#8217;twould seem So vast an obligation to redeem.</p>

<p>24:30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the
man void of understanding; 24:31 And, <span class="lol">lol</span>, it was all grown over with
thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall
thereof was broken down. 24:32 Then I saw, and considered it well: I
looked upon it, and received instruction.</p>

<p>Rather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and verily, where
there is succumbing and leaf-falling, <span class="lol">lol</span>, there doth Life sacrifice
itself--for power! That I have to be struggle, and becoming, and
purpose, and cross-purpose-- ah, he who divineth my will, divineth
well also on what CROOKED paths it hath to tread!</p>

<p>And the inhabitants of this isle shall say in that day: <span class="lol">Lol</span> this was
our hope, to whom we fled for help, to deliver us from the face of the
king of the Assyrians: and how shall we be able to escape? Isaias

prophecy against the Edomites and the Arabians.</p>

<p>52:6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
52:7 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted
in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his
wickedness. 52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God:
I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.</p>

<p>30:3 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again
the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I
will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers,
and they shall possess it. 30:4 And these are the words that the LORD
spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, thus shall the man be blessed, that seeketh God with all his
heart, and receiveth not his soul in vain. This man in receiving the
Holy Eucharist obtaineth the great grace of Divine Union; because he
hath not regard to his own devotion and comfort, but, above all
devotion and comfort, to the glory and honour of God.</p>

<p>[FN#192] As he spoke <span class="lol">lol</span>! in came the damsel who had led them up to the
balcony and said to him, &quot;O Abu al-Hasan, arise thou and thy friend
and come down, for of a truth the world hath waxed strait upon us and
I fear lest our case be discovered or the Caliph become aware of you;
unless you descend at once we are dead ones.</p>

<p>10:7 Then said I, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
of me,) to do thy will, O God. 10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and
offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not,
neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law; 10:9
Then said he, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I come to do thy will, O God.</p>

<p>[FN#120] Then <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the old trot called to her daughter who
came forth from the bower wherein she was, and the Caliph looking at
this young lady owned that he had never sighted amongst his women
aught fairer than this, a model of beauty and loveliness and
brilliancy and perfect face and stature of symmetric grace.</p>

<p>4:13 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,
and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning
darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD,
The God of hosts, is his name. 5:1 Hear ye this word which I take up
against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.</p>

<p>11:16 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not
visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor
heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he
shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. 11:17
Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock!</p>

<p>Then spake Giaflaug, Giuki&#8217;s sister: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> upon earth I live most
loveless Who of five mates Must see the ending, Of daughters twain And

<p>And the people of the islands met and said: &quot;The beasts we know, but
<span class="lol">lol</span>! these sailors tell of things beyond that know us as we know the
beasts and use us for their pleasure as we use the beasts, but yet are
apt to answer idle prayer flung up at evening near the hearth, when a
man returneth from the ploughing of the fields.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> all ye, hark ye, dear children, and listen to me, For I am that
holy Se lone&#8217; se ka&#8217; ra an ve&#8216;; My work upon earth is holy, holy and

Father hath se-ve&#8217;-ned to you That power which is holy and that faith
which is true; O then, my beloved, why will ye delay?</p>

<p>The music drew her on to the glad air From forth the chamber of
enchanted death, And <span class="lol">lol</span>! the world was waking everywhere; The wind
went by, a cool delicious breath, Like that which in the gardens
wandereth, The golden gardens of the Hesperides, And in its song
unheard of things it saith, The myriad marvels of the fairy seas.</p>

<p>XVII Of high and superhuman genius, tied By love and blood, <span class="lol">lol</span>! Pico
and Pio true; He that approaches at the kinsmen&#8217;s side, -- So honoured

is the man I so desire to view, That Sannazaro, who persuades the nine
To leave their fountain for the foaming brine.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, even sons of Zeus, The Thunder-king, have perished, overborne By
evil fate. Immortal though I be, Mine own son Orpheus died, whose
magic song Drew all the forest-trees to follow him, And every craggy
rock and river-stream, And blasts of winds shrill-piping stormy-
breathed, And birds that dart through air on rushing wings.</p>

<p>11:6 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the
LORD: but, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour&#8217;s
hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land,
and out of their hand I will not deliver them. 11:7 And I will feed
the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock.</p>

<p>They draw rein by the mound, and one lights down, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it is Long
Nicholas; and he took Ralph in his arms, and kissed him and wept over
him for all his grizzled beard and his gaunt limbs; but few words he
had for him, save this: &quot;My little Lord, was it thou that was the wise
captain to-day, or this stout lifter and reiver!</p>

<p>Then they reached a glade, Where under one long lane of cloudless air
Before another wood, the royal crown Sparkled, and swaying upon a
restless elm Drew the vague glance of Vivien, and her Squire; Amazed
were these; &#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span> there&#8217; she cried--&#8217;a crown-- Borne by some high lord-
prince of Arthur&#8217;s hall, And there a horse! the rider?</p>

<p>37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
dreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,
<span class="lol">lol</span>, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 37:8 And his
brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?</p>

<p>*scarcely <span class="lol">Lol</span>! he that held himselfe so cunning, And scorned them that

<p>THE BOSOM OF NOORNA Now, while a thousand sparks of fire were bursting
on the sight of the two divers, and they speeded heels uppermost to
the destiny marked out for them by the premeditations of the All-Wise,
<span class="lol">lol</span>! Noorna was on the mountain in outer Aklis with Koorookh, waiting
for the appearance of her betrothed, Sword in hand.</p>

<p>So wounded to his hut and wearily Came Menelaus; and he bow&#8217;d his head
Beneath the lintel neither fair nor high; And, <span class="lol">lol</span>! Queen Helen lay
upon his bed, Flush&#8217;d like a child in sleep, and rosy-red, And at his
footstep did she wake and smile, And spake: &quot;My lord, how hath thy

<p>[The turning point of Li Shih-min&#8217;s campaign in 621 A.D. against the
two rebels, Tou Chien-te, King of Hsia, and Wang Shih-ch`ung, Prince
of Cheng, was his seizure of the heights of Wu-lao, in spike of which
Tou Chien-te persisted in his attempt to relieve his ally in <span class="lol">Lol</span>-yang,
was defeated and taken prisoner. See CHIU T`ANG, ch.</p>

<p>THE WELL OF PARAVID Now, there was haste in the movements of Noorna
bin Noorka, and she arrayed herself and clutched Shibli Bagarag by the
arm, and the twain departed from Feshnavat the Vizier, and came to the
outside of the city, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! there was the Genie by a well under a
palm, and he standing in the shape of an Ass, saddled.</p>

<p>Thus is it that ye too shall be brought forth.5 And one of his signs
it is that He hath created you out of dust; then <span class="lol">lol</span>! ye become men who
spread themselves far and wide: And one of his signs it is, that He
hath created wives for you of your own species,6 that ye may dwell
with them, and hath put love and tenderness between you.</p>

<p>For back do you look, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, Forward the harvest of grain! - Numbers
in council, awake To love more than things of my lap, Love me; and to
let the types break, Men be grass, rocks rivers, all flow; All save
the dream sink alike To the source of my vital in sap: Their battle,
their loss, their ache, For my pledge of vitality know.</p>

<p>Folk shouted for joy, and the fathers who were standing within the
gate heard his word and rejoiced, and some of them ran off to tell
King Peter that his son was come back victorious already; so that by
then he had dismounted at the Guest-house door, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there was the King
and his wife with him, and both they alboun for departure.</p>

<p>So another time passed, till at last Robin asked young David once more
what he saw; and David said, &quot;I hear the cuckoo singing, and I see how
the wind makes waves in the barley field; and now over the hill to the
church cometh an old friar, and in his hands he carries a great bunch
of keys; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! Now he cometh to the church door.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, my betrothed, thou art in possession of the three means that melt
opposition, and the fault is thine if thou fail. &#8217; He did as she
directed; and they were taken on a tide and advanced rapidly to the
mountain, so that the waters smacked and crackled beneath the shell,
covering it with silver showering arches of glittering spray.</p>

<p>Men&#8217;s right of bequeathing their all to their own (With little regard
for the creatures they squeezed); Their mill and mill-water and nether
mill-stone Tied fast to their infant; <span class="lol">lol</span>, this is the last Of their
hungers, by prudent devices appeased. The law they decree is their
ultimate slave; Wherein we perceive old Voracity glassed.</p>

<p>Not thine alone, he shall cause many more great strongholds to perish,
Yes, many temples of gods to the ravening fire shall deliver,--
Temples which stand now surely with sweat of their terror down-
streaming, Quaking with dread; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! from the topmost roof to the
pavement Dark blood trickles, forecasting the dire unavoidable evil.</p>

<p>Then Ali Baba lavished upon her thanks and expressions of gratitude,
saying, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, these two times hast thou saved me from his hand,&#8221; and
falling upon her neck he cried, &#8220;See thou art free, and as reward for
this thy fealty I have wedded thee to my nephew. &#8221; Then turning to the
youth he said, &quot;Do as I bid thee and thou shalt prosper.</p>

<p>Then from her locks the helm Achilles tore And boasted o&#8217;er the slain;
but <span class="lol">lol</span>, the face Of her thus lying in the dust and gore Seem&#8217;d
lovelier than is the maiden grace Of Artemis, when weary from the
chase, She sleepeth in a haunted dell unknown. And all the Argives
marvell&#8217;d for a space, But most Achilles made a heavy moan: XXXVII.</p>

<p>5:6 And I beheld, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, in the midst of the throne and of the four
beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been
slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits
of God sent forth into all the earth. 5:7 And he came and took the
book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</p>

<p>XXXIII With squinting look and dark, and but one eye, The leader of
the troop, of brutish cheer Was he, the foremost of the company; By a
blow blinded, which from nose to ear Had cleft his jaw: when he did so
descry Seated beside the maid, that cavalier, He turned about and
said: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! in the net Another bird for whom it was not set!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, there thou stand&#8217;st, a breathing valiant man, Of an invincible
unconquer&#8217;d spirit! This is the latest glory of thy praise That I, thy
enemy, due thee withal; For ere the glass, that now begins to run,
Finish the process of his sandy hour, These eyes, that see thee now
well colored, Shall see thee wither&#8217;d, bloody, pale, and dead.</p>

<p>The Minister, replying &#8220;To hear is to obey,&#8221; bade bring the frying
pan, threw therein the cleansed fish and set it over the fire; when
<span class="lol">lol</span>! the wall crave asunder, and out burst a black slave like a huge
rock or a remnant of the tribe Ad[FN#108] bearing in hand a branch of
a green tree; and he cried in loud and terrible tones, &quot;O fish!</p>

<p>Now when Shams al-Nahar heard these verses sung by the slave-girl, she
could not keep her seat; but fell down in a fainting-fit whereupon the
Caliph cast the cup from his hand and drew her to him crying out; and
the damsels also cried out, and the Prince of True Believers turned
her over and shook her, and <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! she was dead.</p>

<p>She spake, and touched the prize, and all grew dim I heard no voice of
anger&#8217;d Deity, But round me did the night air swoon and swim, And,
when I waken&#8217;d, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the sun was high, And in that place accursed did I
lie, Where Agelaus found the naked child; Then with swift foot I did
arise and fly Forth from the deeps of that enchanted wild.</p>

<p>While he was preparing to crush, forever, the Protestant Church, with
the arms which a bench of bishops were forging, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the rapid and
desperate Maurice, with long red beard streaming like a meteor in the
wind, dashing through the mountain passes, at the head of his lancers
--arguments more convincing than all the dogmas of Granvelle!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, said Merlin, where she lieth dead. And King Pellam lay so, many
years sore wounded, and might never be whole till Galahad the haut
prince healed him in the quest of the Sangreal, for in that place was
part of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that Joseph of Arimathea
brought into this land, and there himself lay in that rich bed.</p>

<p>It was on a night when they were so together, the damsel leaning on
his arm, her eyes toward the lake, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! what seemed the reflection
of a large star in the water; and there was darkness in the sky above
it, thick clouds, and no sight of the heavens; so she held her face to
him sideways and said, &#8217;What meaneth this, O my betrothed?</p>

<p>So when this tadpole, that was once terrible to me, became turbaned,
shoed, and shawled with darkness, and there was little of him
remaining visible, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a concluding flash shot from thy star, and he
fell heavily down the sky and below the hills, into the sea, that is
the Enchanted Sea, whose Queen is Rabesqurat, Mistress of Illusions.</p>

<p>Now, when it was night, Shibli Bagarag heard a noise at his lattice,
and he arose and peered through it, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the hawk was fluttering
without; so he let it in, and caressed it, and the hawk bade him put
on his silken dress and carry forth his China jar, and go the round of
the palace, and offer drink to the sentinels and the slaves.</p>

<p>2:11 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 2:12 The
flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come,
and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 2:13 The fig tree
putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give
a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>

<p>Others said light clouds rolled upward from the grotto in Thunder
Mountain like to the mists that leave behind them the dew, but <span class="lol">lol</span>!
even as they faded the bright garments of the Rainbow women might be
seen fluttering, and the broidery and paintings of these dancers of
the mist were more beautiful than the costumes of the Corn Maidens.</p>

<p>Look to the blowing Rose about us--&#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, Laughing,&#8217; she says, &#8216;into the
world I blow, At once the silken tassel of my Purse Tear, and its
Treasure on the Garden throw. &#8217; And those who husbanded the Golden
grain And those who flung it to the winds like Rain Alike to no such
aureate Earth are turn&#8217;d As, buried once, Men want dug up again.</p>

<p>I will not live,&#8220; says Brynhild, &#8221;for Sigurd has bewrayed me, yea, and
thee no less, whereas thou didst suffer him to come into my bed: <span class="lol">lol</span>
thou, two men in one dwelling I will not have; and this shall be
Sigurd&#8217;s death, or thy death, or my death; -- for now has he told

<p>Thereupon, she stuck the needle in the door, and he pulled the thread,
and the door drew apart, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a small chamber, and on a raised
cushion of blue satin a glittering crown, thick with jewels as a
frost, such as Ambition pineth to wear, and the knees of men weaken
and bend beholding, and it lanced lights about it like a living sun.</p>

<p>Then stoop&#8217;d she down, and watch&#8217;d the crystal stream, And fishes
poising where the waters ran, And <span class="lol">lol</span>! upon the glass a golden gleam,
And purple as of robes Sidonian, Then, sudden turning, she beheld a
man, That knelt beside her; as her own face fair Was his, and o&#8217;er his
shoulders for a span Fell the bright tresses of his yellow hair.</p>

<p>1:16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I am come to great
estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been
before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom
and knowledge. 1:17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know
madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>18:28 Then Peter said, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, we have left all, and followed thee. 18:29
And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that
hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for
the kingdom of God&#8217;s sake, 18:30 Who shall not receive manifold more
in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</p>

<p>Then she stood up, weak and tottering still, and Ralph arose and put
his left arm about her to stay her; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, there before them was
Richard kneeling over the wild-man, and the Sage was coming back from
the river with his headpiece full of water; so Ralph cried out: &quot;To
horse, Richard, to horse! Hast thou not done slaying the woodman?</p>

<p>The King gave orders accordingly and set out taking the hawk on fist;
and they fared merrily forwards till they made a Wady[FN#87] where
they planted a circle of nets for the chase; when <span class="lol">lol</span>! a gazelle came
within the toils and the King cried, &quot;Whoso alloweth yon gazelle to
spring over his head and loseth her, that man will I surely slay.</p>

<p>*except <span class="lol">Lol</span>, how that he, which firste said this thing, Of philosophers

<p>As I was frolicking along the steep sandbanks of the river, plump, in
a moment, the whole concern slid from under me, and I after it, some
ten fathoms deep;--there I lay, and, as I was recovering my five
senses, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold, the most sparkling water in the gravel! Not so

<p>He had a wee titty that <span class="lol">lol</span>&#8217;ed na me, Because I was twice as bonnie as

<p>7), &#8220;Behold Christ is gone before you into Galilee, there ye shall see

<p>Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues Must needs want pleading

Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue, So I may keep mine eyes:

<p>Shibli Bagarag lifted the bar to the shoulder of Abarak, and poised
it, and peered through the length of it, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! there was a sea

<p>But there his fellows on his wondrous shield Laid the fair body of
Achilles slain, And sadly bare him through the trampled field, And <span class="lol">lol</span>!

<p>Your pier-glass or extensive surface of polished steel made to be

<p>Due Summerward, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they were set, In volumes of foliage proud, On the

for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. 25:10 For in
this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be
trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the
dunghill.</p>

<p>37:8 And when I beheld, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in
them. 37:9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son
of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the
four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may
live.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here, my sons, are all the golden mines, Inestimable drugs and
precious stones, More worth than Asia and the world beside; And from
th&#8217; Antarctic Pole eastward behold As much more land, which never was
descried, Wherein are rocks of pearl that shine as bright As all the
lamps that beautify the sky! And shall I die, and this unconquered?</p>

<p>Sometimes hopping along on one leg, and smiling, and waving his arms,
and causing the ample folds and sleeves of his smock to flutter until
he seemed to be moving in the midst of a nimbus, Nilushka would sing
in a halting whisper the childish ditty: 0h <span class="lol">Lol</span>-ord, pardon me! Wo-
olves run, And do-ogs run, And the hunters wait To kill the wolves.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, they passed by the stream of Parthenius as it flows into the
sea, a most gentle river, where the maid, daughter of Leto, when she
mounts to heaven after the chase, cools her limbs in its much-desired
waters. Then they sped onward in the night without ceasing, and passed
Sesamus and lofty Erythini, Crobialus, Cromna and woody Cytorus.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, thus by smelling and threadbare array, If that men list, this folk
they knowe may. And if a man will ask them privily, Why they be
clothed so unthriftily,* *shabbily They right anon will rownen* in his
ear, *whisper And sayen, if that they espied were, Men would them
slay, because of their science: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, thus these folk betrayen
innocence!</p>

<p>At mine own funeral feast, had I been slain, But, fearing Zeus, they
halted for a space, And <span class="lol">lol</span>, Apollo&#8217;s priestess with a train Of holy
maidens came into that place, And far did she outshine the rest in
grace, But in her eyes such dread was frozen then As glares eternal
from the Gorgon&#8217;s face Wherewith Athene quells the ranks of men.

<p>37:1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which
was full of bones, 37:2 And caused me to pass by them round about:
and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they
were very dry. 37:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones
live?</p>

<p>Evelyn writes in his Diary (November 27th, 1665): &quot;There was no small
suspicion of my Lord Sandwich having permitted divers commanders who
were at ye taking of ye East India prizes to break bulk and take to
themselves jewels, silkes, &amp;c., tho&#8217; I believe some whom I could name
fill&#8217;d their pockets, my <span class="lol">Lol</span>. Sandwich himself had the least share.</p>

<p>* <span class="lol">Lol</span>, all my bones with passion-lowe go rot! &#8217; Now there was a deadly
feud between King Teghmus and a certain King of Hind, by name Kafíd,
who had great plenty of troops and warriors and champions; and under
his hand were a thousand puissant chieftains, each ruling over a
thousand tribes whereof every one could muster four thousand
cavaliers.</p>

<p>Now when the Emir Salamah heard these his son&#8217;s verses, he bade pack
for him four camel loads of the rarest stuffs, and he largessed to him
a she-dromedary laden with thrones of red gold; then he said to him,
&#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, O my son, I have given thee more than thou askedst. &#8221; &#8220;O my
father,&#8221; replied Habib, &quot;where are my steed and my sword and my spear?</p>

<p>Nay tis most credible, we heere receiue it, A certaintie vouch&#8217;d from

Approu&#8217;d so to your Maiesty, may pleade For amplest credence King.</p>

<p>As he looked about him right and left, <span class="lol">lol</span>! his eyes fell on a young
man, who was carrying a tunic and crying it for sale at fifteen
dinars: so he considered him and saw him to be like his brother Sa&#8217;id;
and indeed it was his very self, but he was wan of blee and changed
for long strangerhood and the travails of travel, so that he knew him
not.</p>

<p>I cry when melancholy tries my sprite * Last not, O world nor work
more despight; <span class="lol">Lol</span> hangs my soul &#8216;twixt hardship and affright. Were the
Sultan hight Love but fair to me, * Slumber mine eyes&#8217; companion were
to me, My Lords, some little mercy spare to me, * Chief of my tribe:
be debonnair to me, Whom Love cast down, erst rich now pauper-wight!</p>

<p>Know that the same thing is true of the eyes as of the glass and the
lantern; for the light strikes the eyes in which the heart is
accustomed to see itself reflected, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it sees some light
outside, and many other things, some green, some purple, others red or
blue; and some it dislikes, and some it likes, scorning some and
prizing others.</p>

<p>And as he continued in this case <span class="lol">lol</span>! a pastern of the palace, which
was carefully kept private, swung open and out of it came twenty slave
girls surrounding his bother&#8217;s wife who was wondrous fair, a model of
beauty and comeliness and symmetry and perfect loveliness and who
paced with the grace of a gazelle which panteth for the cooling
stream.</p>

<p>[FN#505] And he gave the king much counsel, and at last said, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, I
am Khizr,&#8221; and vanished. [FN#506] The discovery of the king&#8217;s
illegitimate birth, which occurs in so many versions, has its
parallels in the story of the Nephew of Hippocrates in the &#8220;Seven Wise
Masters,&#8221; and the Lady&#8217;s 2nd Story in Mr. Gibb&#8217;s translation of the
&quot;Forty Vezírs.</p>

<p>It is God who sendeth the winds and uplifteth the clouds, and, as He
pleaseth, spreadeth them on high, and breaketh them up; and thou
mayest see the rain issuing from their midst; and when He poureth it
down on such of his servants as He pleaseth, <span class="lol">lol</span>! they are filled with
joy, Even they who before it was sent down to them, were in mute
despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, dear grandchildren, I will let you out,&#8221; said the old
woman as she untied the bag: and <span class="lol">lol</span>, the grouse flock with achuck-a
-chuck-achuck flew up, knocking over the old grandmother and flew out
of the square smoke opening of the winter lodge. The old woman caught
only one grouse as it flew up and held it, grasping a leg with each
hand.</p>

<p>Now when I came to the well I marked not them by it, but plunged, and
the depth of that well seemed to me the very depth of the earth
itself, so went I ever downward; and when I was near the bottom of the
well I had forgotten life above, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! no sooner had I touched the
bottom of the well when my head emerged from the surface: &#8217;twas
wondrous!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, where thy father Lot beside the hearth Lies like a log, and all
but smouldered out! For ever since when traitor to the King He fought
against him in the Barons&#8217; war, And Arthur gave him back his
territory, His age hath slowly droopt, and now lies there A yet-warm
corpse, and yet unburiable, No more; nor sees, nor hears, nor speaks,
nor knows.</p>

<p>49:15 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised
among men. 49:16 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of
thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that
holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as
high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>LXXXIV A statue no less jocund, no less bright, Succeeds, and on the
writing is impressed; <span class="lol">Lol</span>! Hercules&#8217; daughter, Isabella hight, In whom
Ferrara deems her city blest, Much more because she first shall see
the light Within its circuit, than for all the rest Which kind and
favouring Fortune in the flow Of rolling years, shall on that town
bestow.</p>

<p>Though in the wood I understood Ye had a paramour, All this may nought
remove my thought, But that I will be your&#8217;: And she shall find me
soft and kind And courteis every hour; Glad to fulfil all that she

<p>When he looked upon the boy, his eyes were dazzled and his wit
confounded, and exemplified in him was the saying of the poet, &quot;While
that fair-faced boy abode in the place, * Moon of breakfast-fête he
lit by his face,[FN#381] <span class="lol">Lol</span>! there came a Shaykh with leisurely pace *
A reverend trusting to Allah&#8217;s grace, And ascetic signals his gait
display&#8217;d.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> here this Arcite, and this Palamon, That quietly were out of my

yet hath love, *maugre their eyen two*, *in spite of their eyes*
Y-brought them hither bothe for to die. Now look ye, is not this an
high folly?</p>

<p>VII Let others sing of Knights and Paladines In aged accents and
untimely words, Paint shadows in imaginary lines, Which well the reach
of their high wit records: But I must sing of thee, and those fair
eyes Authentic shall my verse in time to come; When yet th&#8217; unborn
shall say, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, where she lies! Whose beauty made him speak, that else
was dumb!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I will make thee to stand, for to show thee My power, and that My
Name may be declared throughout all the earth. &#8220;[159] Having searched
his list of the gods of the nations in vain for a mention of the God
of the Hebrews, Pharaoh cited before him the wise men of Egypt, and he
said to them: &#8221;Have ye ever heard the name of the God of these people?</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> here, said he, the walls of the city! in showing them the
inhabitants and citizens thereof, so strong, so well armed, and so
expert in military discipline; signifying thereby that there is no
wall but of bones, and that towns and cities cannot have a surer wall
nor better fortification than the prowess and virtue of the citizens
and inhabitants.</p>

<p>6:6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his
hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 6:7 And he
laid it upon my mouth, and said, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, this hath touched thy lips; and
thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. 6:8 Also I heard the
voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?</p>

<p>Those who live near the walls desert their homes, For <span class="lol">lol</span>! with hissing
serpents in her hair, Waving in downward whirl a blazing pine, A fiend
patrols the town, like that which erst At Thebes urged on Agave (24),
or which hurled Lycurgus&#8217; bolts, or that which as he came From Hades
seen, at haughty Juno&#8217;s word, Brought terror to the soul of Hercules.</p>

<p>It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world
can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The
treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom&#8217;d: the foul
practice Hath turn&#8217;d itself on me; <span class="lol">lol</span>, here I lie, Never to rise
again: thy mother&#8217;s poison&#8217;d: I can no more:--the king, the king&#8217;s to
blame. Ham.</p>

<p>When he came to the corner of the court in which he lived, <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold there was the pony again! Yes, there he was, looking more
obstinate than ever; and alone in the chaise, keeping a steady watch
upon his every wink, sat Mr Abel, who, lifting up his eyes by chance
and seeing Kit pass by, nodded to him as though he would have nodded
his head off.</p>

<p>Then Ralph saw a man in golden armour of strange, outlandish fashion,
sitting on a great black horse beside the Lord&#8217;s litter; and Otter
said: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! my Lord, armed and a-horseback to meet my lady: she looketh
kinder on him thus; though in thine ear be it said, he is no great man
of war; nor need he be, since he hath us for his shield and his
hauberk.</p>

<p>But when the frog said the words over again, she went and took an axe
and chopped off its head, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! and behold, there stood before her a
handsome young prince, who told her that he had been enchanted by a
wicked magician, and he could never be unspelled till some girl would
do his bidding for a whole night, and chop off his head at the end of
it.</p>

<p>Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat&#8217;s bow, and
with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild
exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his
poised lance, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its
quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies
of the oarsmen.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> yet, before, ye must do more, If ye will go with me: As, cut your
hair up by your ear, Your kirtle by the knee; With bow in hand for to
withstand Your enemies, if need be: And this same night, before
daylight, To woodward will I flee. If that ye will all this fulfil, Do
it shortly as ye can: Else will I to the green-wood go, Alone, a
banished man.</p>

<p>Its pale eyes then; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the long array Of guards in golden arms,
and Priests beside, _4460 Singing their bloody hymns, whose garbs
betray The blackness of the faith it seems to hide; And see, the
Tyrant&#8217;s gem-wrought chariot glide Among the gloomy cowls and
glittering spears-- A Shape of light is sitting by his side, _4465 A
child most beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> Shang, confiding in these promises, march out all his best troops,
and placed Wei Po and others at their head with orders to attack at
P`o-t`ai&#8217;s bidding. Meanwhile, Li Hsiung&#8217;s general, Li Hsiang, had
prepared an ambuscade on their line of march; and P`o-t`ai, having
reared long scaling-ladders against the city walls, now lighted the
beacon-fire.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, methinks I surely pierced a wild stag with the Teutonic sword
which is called Snyrtir: from which I won the name of Warrior, when I
felled Agnar, son of Ingild, and brought the trophy home. He shattered
and broke with the bite the sword Hoding which smote upon my head, and
would have dealt worse wounds if the edge of his blade had held out
better.</p>

<p>As soon as it was the second day he repaired to the house of the woman
who again gave him somewhat to break his fast and he fell to felling
the wall even as he had done on the first day and he worked till noon;
but when it was midday and all the household was asleep, <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold! he found in the middle of the foundation a crock[FN#265] full
of gold.</p>

<p>At the sight hereof the said midwives were much amazed, yet some of
them said, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, here is good provision, and indeed we need it; for we
drink but lazily, as if our tongues walked on crutches, and not
lustily like Lansman Dutches. Truly this is a good sign; there is
nothing here but what is fit for us; these are the spurs of wine, that
set it a-going.</p>

<p>2:9 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a
roll of a book was therein; 2:10 And he spread it before me; and it
was written within and without: and there was written therein
lamentations, and mourning, and woe. 3:1 Moreover he said unto me, Son
of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the
house of Israel.</p>

<p>A. H. 328 = 940 we read:--A sponger found ten criminals and followed
them, imagining they were going to a feast; but <span class="lol">lol</span>, they were going to
their deaths! And when they were slain and he remained, he was brought
before the Khalifah (Al Maamun) and Ibrahim son of Al- Mahdi related a
tale to procure pardon for the man, whereupon the Khalifah pardoned
him.</p>

<p>In changed voice, right for his very dread, Which voice eke quak&#8217;d,
and also his mannere Goodly* abash&#8217;d, and now his hue is red,
*becomingly Now pale, unto Cresside, his lady dear, With look
downcast, and humble *yielden cheer,* *submissive face* <span class="lol">Lol</span>!
*altherfirste word that him astert,* *the first word he said* Was
twice: &quot;Mercy, mercy, my dear heart!</p>

<p>Hardly, however, had they ended their words when <span class="lol">lol</span>! the owner of the
camel came upon them (for he had overheard their speech and had said
to himself, &#8220;By Allah, these three fellows have driven off my
property, inasmuch as they have described the burthen and eke the
beast as tail-less and one-eyed&#8221;), and cried out, &quot;Ye three have
carried away my camel!</p>

<p>If ever I have spread out a tranquil heaven above me, and have flown
into mine own heaven with mine own pinions: If I have swum playfully
in profound luminous distances, and if my freedom&#8217;s avian wisdom hath
come to me:-- --Thus however speaketh avian wisdom:--&quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, there is no
above and no below! Throw thyself about,--outward, backward, thou
light one!</p>

<p>Thus six months passed over us, when it chanced one day that the two
friends, to wit, Sa&#8217;di and Sa&#8217;d, came to my quarter of the town, when
quoth Sa&#8217;d to Sa&#8217;di, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, yonder is the street where dwelleth Hasan
al-Habbal. Come let us go and see how he hath added to his stock and
how far he hath prospered by means of the two hundred Ashrafis thou
gavest him.</p>

<p>THE PALACE OF AKLIS Now, Shibli Bagarag assured himself of his three
spells, and made his heart resolute, and hastened up the reddened
marble steps of the Palace; and when he was on the topmost step, <span class="lol">lol</span>!
one with a man&#8217;s body and the head of a buffalo, that prostrated
himself, and prayed the youth obsequiously to enter the palace with
the title of King.</p>

<p>3:25 He answered and said, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I see four men loose, walking in the
midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth
is like the Son of God. 3:26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the
mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth,
and come hither.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have gardens there without noise or strife, And there is the
Tree of immortal Life: Four rivers circle that blissful bound; And
Spirits float o&#8217;er it, and Spirits go round: There, set in the midst,
is the golden throne; And the Maker of all things sits thereon: A
rainbow o&#8217;er-hangs him; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! therein The beams are His Holy Ones
washed from sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon a bier, branch-strewn, They laid their man, and o&#8217;er him spread a
cloth; Then, moving towards that smoke behind the pines, They found
the Saint and brought him to that bier, And made their moan--and
Garban &#8217;neath that cloth Smiled as he heard it--&quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, our friend is
dead! Great prophet kneel; and pray the God thou serv&#8217;st To raise him
from the dead.</p>

<p>To conclude, his soldiers in the Gallic triumph, amongst other verses,
such as they jocularly sung on those occasions, following the
general&#8217;s chariot, recited these, which since that time have become
extremely common: The Gauls to Caesar yield, Caesar to Nicomede, <span class="lol">Lol</span>!
Caesar triumphs for his glorious deed, But Caesar&#8217;s conqueror gains no
victor&#8217;s meed.</p>

<p>After giving the sad history of his slave-life--the common lot of that
class of goods and chattels--he said: &quot;Missus I stay&#8217;d thar as long as
I could, when I seed my brodder in de <span class="lol">Lol</span>&#8216;d hangin&#8217; on a tree not
more&#8217;n a hundred rods from my house, near Baton Rouge. A sistah was
hanged five miles off, on de plank road, in West Baton Rouge, in a
little woods.</p>

<p>Now the bells began to clash from the great tower of the minster, and
in a little while they had clashed themselves into order and rang
clear and tuneably for a space; and while they were ringing, <span class="lol">lol</span>! those
gay-clad people departed from the scaffold, and a canvas painted like
a mountain-side, rocky and with caves therein, was drawn up at the
back of it.</p>

<p>The wilderness had patted him on the head, and, behold, it was like a
ball--an ivory ball; it had caressed him, and--<span class="lol">lol</span>!-- he had withered;
it had taken him, loved him, embraced him, got into his veins,
consumed his flesh, and sealed his soul to its own by the
inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation. He was its
spoiled and pampered favorite.</p>

<p>Then with his hand he shook the mighty wall; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! the turrets nod,
the bulwarks fall: Easy as when ashore an infant stands, And draws
imagined houses in the sands; The sportive wanton, pleased with some
new play, Sweeps the slight works and fashion&#8217;d domes away: Thus
vanish&#8217;d at thy touch, the towers and walls; The toil of thousands in
a moment falls.</p>

<p>33:33 And when this cometh to pass, (<span class="lol">lol</span>, it will come,) then shall
they know that a prophet hath been among them. 34:1 And the word of
the LORD came unto me, saying, 34:2 Son of man, prophesy against the
shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed
themselves!</p>

<p>140 `And I to ben your verray humble trewe, Secret, and in my paynes

<p>When the holy man saw that his denial was of no avail and that I irked
him with exceeding persistence, he put the smallest bit of ointment on
my right lid and, as I opened wide my eyes, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! both were
stone-blind: naught could I see for the black darkness before them and
ever since that day have I been sightless and helpless as thou
foundest me.</p>

<p>VII Guard thyself, Charles: for, <span class="lol">lol</span>! against thee blown Is such a
storm, that I no refuge see: Nor these redoubted monarchs come alone,
But those of Sericane and Circassy; While Fortune, who would probe
thee to the bone, Has taken those two shining stars from thee, Who
kept thee by their wisdom and their light; And thou remainest blind
and wrapt in night.</p>

<p>A Rondel of Love <span class="lol">LOL</span>, quhat it is to love Learn ye that list to prove,
By me, I say, that no ways may The ground of grief remove, But still
decay both nicht and day: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, quhat it is to love! Love is ane fervent
fire Kindlit without desire, Short pleasure, long displeasure,
Repentance is the hire; Ane pure tressour without measour; Love is ane
fervent fire.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> you, my friend, the beginnings of evil in those long past days, and
the seeds of ill-hap sown in the field of my new life even before the
furrow was turned. &quot;Well, we came soon into my lord&#8217;s country, and
fair and rich and lovely was it in those days; free from trouble and
unpeace, a happy abode for the tillers of the soil, and the fashioners
of wares.</p>

<p>&#8217;And <span class="lol">lol</span>, I say a time, and a time, and a half-time shall not pass by
before my voice shall be heard, and my word sounded forth to the
nations abroad. But in the Zion of my likeness and true righteousness
shall it be received first, and from thence shall it go forth; for
thus and thus hath the God of heaven and earth declared and purposed
that it should be.</p>

<p>Yea, sure,&#8220; said the good man; &#8221;<span class="lol">lol</span>, yonder where thou seest two great
fires, there shalt thou find him, and more treasure than I suppose is
in all France beside. &quot; Then the king called to him Sir Bedver and Sir
Kay, and commanded them to make ready horse and harness for himself
and them; for after evening he would ride on pilgrimage to St.
Michael&#8217;s Mount.</p>

<p>She flashed her figure in the glass, and was lovely therein as one in
the light of Paradise; but ere she reached the King Mashalleed, <span class="lol">lol</span>!
the hour of the Serpents had struck, and her beauty melted from her as
snow melts from off the rock; and she was suddenly haggard in utter
uncomeliness, and knew it not, but marched, smiling a grand smile, on
to the King.</p>

<p>Shibli Bagarag was tempted in his desire for the golden branch to lift
the iron bar upon Abarak, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! the phial of Paravid fell from his
vest, and he took it, and sprinkled a portion of the waters over the
singing birds, and in a moment they burst into a sweet union of
voices, singing, in the words of the poet: When for one serpent were
two asses match?</p>

<p>Yes, certes; <span class="lol">lol</span>, these stories bear witness. &lt;22&gt; When thirty tyrants
full of cursedness* *wickedness Had slain Phidon in Athens at the
feast, They commanded his daughters to arrest, And bringe them before
them, in despite, All naked, to fulfil their foul delight; And in
their father&#8217;s blood they made them dance Upon the pavement, -- God
give them mischance.</p>

<p>LXVIII This as it may: the Child would meet his fate, Ere by so vile a
band be prisoner led; When, <span class="lol">lol</span>! forth issuing from the city&#8217;s gate,
Whose wall appeared like shining gold I said, Two youthful dames, not
born in low estate, If measured by their mien and garb, nor bred By
swain, in early wants and troubles versed; But amid princely joys in
palace nursed!</p>

<p>Both drank of it and sat down to take their rest; and when an hour of
the day had gone by: <span class="lol">lol</span>! they heard a mighty roar and uproar in the
middle of the main as though the heavens were falling upon the earth;
and the sea brake with waves before them, and from it towered a black
pillar, which grew and grew till it rose skywards and began making for
that meadow.</p>

<p>It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director, the right-
guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds fair-
seeming and worthy celebrating, that as the Sultan was brooding over
this difficulty <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! his son Mohammed appeared before him by
the path which showed written, &quot;This is the path whereon whoso passeth
shall nevermore return.</p>

<p>8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;
and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that
the waters were abated from off the earth. 8:12 And he stayed yet
other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again
unto him any more.</p>

<p>Gunnar says, &#8220;Yet shall it be brought about: and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a rede thereto;
-- let us egg on our brother Guttorm to the deed; he is young, and of
little knowledge, and is clean out of all the oaths moreover. &#8221; &#8220;Ah,
set about in ill wise,&#8221; says Hogni, &quot;and though indeed it may well be
compassed, a due reward shall we gain for the bewrayal of such a man
as is Sigurd.</p>

<p>She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss
her good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great
displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! there
was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her
and a pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on
my entrance.</p>

<p>The while We in the field here gave our cares and toils To make her
great, and fight her a free way To the loftiest earthly good; <span class="lol">lol</span>!
mother Nature Within the peaceful, silent convent walls, Has done her
part, and out of her free grace Hath she bestowed on the beloved child
The god-like; and now leads her thus adorned To meet her splendid
fortune, and my hope.</p>

<p>7:1 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed
grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;
and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, it was the latter growth after the king&#8217;s mowings. 7:2 And it
came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of
the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom
shall Jacob arise?</p>

<p>Then he saw the red serpent hiss and snap at one, darting out its
tongue, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! on the fork of its tongue the little bird let fall the
slip of herb in its bill, and in an instant the serpent changed from
red to yellow and from yellow to pale-spotted blue, and from that to a
speckled indigo-colour, writhing at every change, and hissing fire
from its open jaws.</p>

<p>Finally, Nebuzaradan said to Jeremiah: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, thou art one of three
things; either thou are a prophesier of false things, or thou art a
despiser of suffering, or thou art a shedder of blood. A prophesier of
false things for since many a year hast thou been prophesying the
downfall of this city, and now, when thy prophecy has come true, thou
sorrowest and mournest.</p>

<p>And if we had taken compassion on them, and relieved them from their
trouble, they would have plunged on in their wickedness, wildly
wandering.10 We formerly laid hold on them with chastisement, yet they
did not humble them to their Lord, nor did they abase them; Until,
when we have opened upon them the door of a severe punishment, <span class="lol">lol</span>!
they are in despair at it.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, wing&#8217;d with world&#8217;s wonders, With miracles shod, With the fires of
his thunders For raiment and rod, God trembles in heaven, and his
angels are white with the terror of God. For his twilight is come on
him, His anguish is here; And his spirits gaze dumb on him, Grown gray
from his fear; And his hour taketh hold on him stricken, the last of
his infinite year.</p>

<p>Each to the other&#8217;s bosom clasped, clad in their twinned delight,
Whilst hand with hand and arm with arm about their necks enchain <span class="lol">Lol</span>,
when two hearts are straitly knit in passion and desire, But on cold
iron smite the folk who chide at them in vain. Thou, that for loving
censurest the votaries of love, Canst thou assain a heart diseased or
heal-a cankered brain?</p>

<p>For surely are you one with the white host, Spirits, whose memory is
our vital air, Through the great love of Earth they had: <span class="lol">lol</span>, these,
Like beams that throw the path on tossing seas, Can bid us feel we
keep them in the ghost, Partakers of a strife they joyed to share. M.
M. Who call her Mother and who calls her Wife Look on her grave and
see not Death but Life.</p>

<p>When Ali bin Bakkar and Abu al-Hasan and those present heard Shams al-
Nahar&#8217;s song, they were like to fly for joy, and sported and laughed;
but while they were thus enjoying themselves <span class="lol">lol</span>! up came a damsel,
trembling for fear and said, &quot;O my lady, the Commander of the
Faithful&#8217;s eunuchs are at the door, Afíf and Masrúr and Marján[FN#185]
and others whom wot I not.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, while he put forth his hand tremblingly, as to continue the words
of his condemnation of the Vizier, the heavens were severed by a third
flash, one exceeding in fierceness the other flashes; and now the
Great Hall rocked, and the pillars and thrones trembled, and the eyes
of Shagpat opened. He made no motion, but sat like a wonder of stone,
looking before him.</p>

<p>Then he leaned it over the eye of the glass, in the direction of the
pillar besieged by the billows, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! with one cut, even at that
distance, he divided the fishy monster, and with another severed the
chains that had fettered Noorna; and she arose and smiled blissfully
to the sky, and stood upright, and signalled him to lay the point of
the blade on the pillar.</p>

<p>50:9 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set
themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their
arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
50:10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
satisfied, saith the LORD.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, next two whelps From my hands I loosened, Joyless were both, And
both a-howling; And now their flesh Became naught but corpses, Whereof
must I eat But sore against my will. &#8220; &#8221;O&#8217;er the prey of the fishers
Will folk give doom; From the bright white fish The heads will they
take; Within a few nights, Fey as they are, A little ere day Of that
draught will they eat.</p>

<p>Yea, thou wouldst say that verily so it was, Viewing it from afar; but
when hard by Thou standest, all the illusion vanishes; And <span class="lol">lol</span>, a
steep-browed rock, a fragment rent From Sipylus -- yet Niobe is there,
Dreeing her weird, the debt of wrath divine, A broken heart in guise
of shattered stone. All through the tangle of that desperate fray
Stalked slaughter and doom.</p>

<p>Forthwith they set up a gallows under which they made the Nazarene
stand and the torch bearer, who was hangman, threw the rope round his
neck and passed one end through the pulley, and was about to hoist him
up[FN#509] when <span class="lol">lol</span>! the Reeve, who was passing by, saw the Broker
about to be hanged; and, making his way through the people, cried out
to the executioner, &quot;Hold!</p>

<p>Well can the wise poet of Florence, That highte Dante, speak of this
sentence:* *sentiment <span class="lol">Lol</span>, in such manner* rhyme is Dante&#8217;s tale. *kind

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, it seeketh still to sing as one of the careless, and cannot
relinquish the ring and be as the careless, and between the two there
is neither peace for it nor pleasure. &#8217; Now, while my eyes were on the
pretty bird, dwelling on it, I saw it struck suddenly by an arrow
beneath the left wing, and the bird fluttered to my bosom and dropped
in it the ring from its beak.</p>

<p>Then on his comrade&#8217;s breast Achilles laid His blood-stain&#8217;d hands,
and thus began the wail: &quot;All hail, Patroclus, though in Pluto&#8217;s
realm; All that I promis&#8217;d, <span class="lol">lol</span>! I now perform; That on the corpse of
Hector, hither dragg&#8217;d, Our dogs should feed; and that twelve noble
youths, The sons of Troy, before thy fun&#8217;ral pyre, My hand, in
vengeance for thy death, should slay.</p>

<p>Children listen almost breathlessly to the story of the duel between
&#8220;the gingham dog and the calico cat,&#8221; and to the ballad of &#8220;The
Rock-a-By Lady from Hushaby Street,&#8221; and the dreams which she
brings:-- &quot;There is one little dream of a big sugar plum, And <span class="lol">lol</span>!
thick and fast the other dreams come Of popguns that bang, and tin

<p>And right as they declamed this matere, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, Troilus, right at the

<p>25:19 Thou sayest, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart
lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle
to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with
thee? 25:20 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he
might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought
after the gods of Edom.</p>

<p>We can safely approve Edwin Arnold, as he says: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> I as hid seed
shoots after rainless years, So good and evil, pains and pleasures,
hates And loves, and all dead deeds come forth again, Bearing bright
leaves, or dark, sweet fruit or sour. &#8221; Longfellow also says: &quot;No
action, whether foul or fair, Is ever done, but it leaves somewhere A
record-as a blessing or a curse.</p>

<p>He who hath grown wise concerning old origins, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he will at last
seek after the fountains of the future and new origins.-- O my
brethren, not long will it be until NEW PEOPLES shall arise and new
fountains shall rush down into new depths. For the earthquake--it
choketh up many wells, it causeth much languishing: but it bringeth
also to light inner powers and secrets.</p>

<p>Now (good my Liege) Sir, Royall Sir, forgiue a foolish woman: The loue
I bore your Queene (<span class="lol">Lol</span>, foole againe) Ile speake of her no more, nor
of your Children: Ile not remember you of my owne Lord, (Who is lost
too:) take your patience to you, And Ile say nothing Leo. Thou didst
speake but well, When most the truth: which I receyue much better,
Then to be pittied of thee.</p>

<p>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, Thy old groans ring yet
in mine ancient ears; <span class="lol">Lol</span>, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an
old tear that is not wash&#8217;d off yet: If e&#8217;er thou wast thyself, and
these woes thine, Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline; And art
thou chang&#8217;d? Pronounce this sentence then,-- Women may fall, when
there&#8217;s no strength in men.</p>

<p>&lt;end quote&gt; So when the king of Israel has sinned by &#8220;numbering the
people,&#8221; and they are punished for his fault by a pestilence which
slays seventy thousand innocent men, David cries to Jahveh:-- &lt;quote&gt;
<span class="lol">Lol</span>, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what
have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and
against my father&#8217;s house&quot; (2 Sam.</p>

<p>5:5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as
their children: and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, we bring into bondage our sons and our
daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto
bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other
men have our lands and vineyards. 5:6 And I was very angry when I
heard their cry and these words.</p>

<p>Straightway Ralph came forth from the bushes with his drawn sword in
his hand, and even therewith what with the two knights being both low
upon the earth, what with the woman herself coming from out the shadow
of the oak boughs, and turning her toward Ralph, he saw her clearly,
and stood staring and amazed--for <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was the Lady whom he had
delivered at the want-ways.</p>

<p>Then Amjad kissed the ground before him; but <span class="lol">lol</span>! the King was a Queen,
who was veiled with a mouth-veil, and she said to Amjad, &quot;Know that I
have no design on this your city and that I am come hither only in
quest of a beardless slave of mine, whom if I find with you, I will do
you no harm, but if I find him not, then shall there befall sore
onslaught between me and you.</p>

<p>So the young man arose and rapped and called out, &#8220;Bring in the
breakfast;&#8221; when <span class="lol">lol</span>! the door was opened and there came out of it an
hundred Mamelukes[FN#127] of the Book, each bearing upon his head a
golden tray, whereon were set dishes of precious metals; and these,
which were filled with breakfast-meats of all kinds and colours, they
ranged in order before the Sultan.</p>

<p>Sweet suns green hills are shining o&#8217;er; Soft brooklets burst their
icy chain: Upon the blue translucent river Laughs down an all-
unclouded day, The winged west winds gently quiver, The buds are
bursting from the spray; While birds are blithe on every tree; The
Oread from the mountain-shore Sighs, &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! thy flowers come back to
thee-- Thy child, sad mother, comes no more!</p>

<p>and <span class="lol">lol</span>, a door opened in one of the pillars of jasper leading from the
throne, and there came forth a little man, humped, with legs like
bows, and arms reaching to his feet; in his hand a net weighted with
leaden weights. So the Queen levelled her finger at Noorna, and he
spun the net above her head, and dropped it on her shoulder, and
dragged her with him to the pillar.</p>

<p>THE PLOT Now, while Shibli Bagarag gazed on Shagpat kindled by the
beams of Aklis, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the Genii Karavejis and Veejravoosh circling each
other in swift circles like two sapphire rings toward him, and they
whirled to a point above his head, and fell and prostrated themselves
at his feet: so he cried, &#8217;O ye slaves of the Sword, my servitors! how
of the whereabout of Karaz?</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, of fair issue is there hope: we see The Achaeans falling fast: we
see the might Of our men waxing ever: fear is none Of evil issue now:
the pitiless foe Beleaguer not the town: no desperate need There is
that women should go forth to war. &quot; So cried she, and they hearkened
to the words Of her who had garnered wisdom from the years; So from
afar they watched the fight.</p>

<p>3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the
water: and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the
Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 3:17 And
<span class="lol">lol</span> a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased. 4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the
wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</p>

<p>But King Afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on
the Greek, and they turned their backs from fight and addressed
themselves to flight, making for the ships, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! there came out
upon them from the seacoast another host, led by the Minister Dandan,
the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust, and to lay
load on them with cut and thrust.</p>

<p>And such a smoke gan out wend,* *go Out of this foule trumpet&#8217;s end,

<p>So with fire burning in my heart after what had befallen me, I
wandered about crowded sites and lone spots and in my distraction I
knew not what to do, whither to go or whence to come; when <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold! I found sitting in an unfrequented part of the street a
Maghrabi,[FN#66] a Barbary man, who had before him some written leaves
and was casting omens for sundry bystanders.</p>

<p>Young Kullervo journeyed onward Over vale and over mountain, Playing
on his reed of battle, Till a messenger appearing Brought the warrior
these tidings: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! thy sister too has perished, Perished in the
crystal fountain, Where the waters flow in beauty, Like a silver
serpent winding Through the valley to the ocean; Home return and do
her honor, Lay her in the lap of Kalma.</p>

<p>29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, there
were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they
watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well&#8217;s mouth. 29:3
And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone
from the well&#8217;s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again
upon the well&#8217;s mouth in his place.</p>

<p>8:9 The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: <span class="lol">lol</span>, they
have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them? 8:10
Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to
them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto
the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the
priest every one dealeth falsely.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, how the craggy rock, Adamantine though it seem, the hewers of
stone Amid the hills by wisdom undermine Full lightly, and by wisdom
shipmen cross The thunderous-plunging sea, when mountain-high It
surgeth, and by craft do hunters quell Strong lions, panthers, boars,
yea, all the brood Of wild things. Furious-hearted bulls are tamed To
bear the yoke-bands by device of men.</p>

<p>High with the last line scaled her voice, and this, All in a fiery
dawning wild with wind That shook her tower, the brothers heard, and
thought With shuddering, &#8216;Hark the Phantom of the house That ever
shrieks before a death,&#8217; and called The father, and all three in hurry
and fear Ran to her, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the blood-red light of dawn Flared on her
face, she shrilling, &#8217;Let me die!</p>

<p>When that was done, he ordered the house to be sacked, and the women
and the slaves he divided for a spoil, but he reserved Bhanavar to

upon the lips of Almeryl, and twice was she torn from him as a grape-
bunch is torn from the streaming vine, and the third time she swooned
and the anguish of life left her.</p>

<p>I think I never heard him preach a better sermon than the one on
Aeroplanes (<span class="lol">Lol</span>, what now see you on high Jeremiah Two). So it was that
he spent two whole days making a kite with Chinese wings for Teddy
Moore, the photographer&#8217;s son, and closed down the infant class for
forty-eight hours so that Teddy Moore should not miss the pleasure of
flying it, or rather seeing it flown.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, what saith of them the prophet Isaiah, that under them shall be
strewed moths, and their covertures shall be of worms of hell. And
furthermore, their misease shall be in default of friends, for he is
not poor that hath good friends: but there is no friend; for neither
God nor any good creature shall be friend to them, and evereach of
them shall hate other with deadly hate.</p>

<p>The imperious face Forbidding not, they sprang; but Patrick raised His
hand, and stone-like crouched they chained and still: Then, Dichu
onward striding fierce, the Saint Between them signed the Cross; and
<span class="lol">lol</span>, the sword Froze in his hand, and Dichu stood like stone. The
amazement past, he prayed the man of God To grace his house; and, side

<p>Alas, our thoughts flow on with stream, whose waters _3775 Return not

<p>As he and the merchants came forth from the garden gate, behold, they
saw a great cloud of dust and heard a loud noise of crying and
lamentation; so they looked and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was the Governor with his
attendants and the townsfolk, a world of people, who had come out to
look on, and my master&#8217;s family following them, all screaming and
crying aloud and weeping exceeding sore weeping.</p>

<p>Now after long pondering the matter, when her husband returned home at

<p>2 Nephi 16:6 6 Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live

<p>About three hundred and fifty lines are devoted to the description;
but they merely embody Virgil&#8217;s account of Aeneas&#8217; adventures from the
destruction of Troy to his arrival in Italy; and the only
characteristic passage is the following reflection, suggested by the
death of Dido for her perfidious but fate-compelled guest: <span class="lol">Lol</span>! how a

<p>So he broke into the &#8217;Tivity Hymm, just as at Christmas carol-singing;
when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold, down went the bull on his bended knees, in his
ignorance, just as if &#8217;twere the true &#8217;Tivity night and hour. As soon
as his horned friend were down, William turned, clinked off like a

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>,&#8220; says the crafty promoter of love, borrowing a phrase from the

Cressida comes to dinner; and at table, Helen, Pandarus, and others,
praise the absent Troilus, until &#8221;her heart laughs&quot; for very pride
that she has the love of such a knight.</p>

<p>Then he took the phial, and touched their lips with the waters, and
<span class="lol">lol</span>! they commenced luting and laughing, and singing verses, and
prattling, laughing betweenwhiles at each other; and one, a noisy one,
with long, black, unquiet tresses, and a curved foot and roguish
ankle, sang as she twirled: My heart is another&#8217;s, I cannot be tender;
Yet if thou storm it, I fain must surrender.</p>

dishonour done the gilded spur, Till each would clash the shield, and
blow the horn. But Arthur waved them back.</p>

<p>But &#8216;twan&#8217;t no year, an &#8216;twan&#8217;t no mont&#8217;, en mo&#8217;n dat, hit wan&#8217;t

<p>So Tom ran for dear life, till he came home and got a spade, and then
away with him, as hard as he could go, back to the field of boliauns;
but when he got there, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! not a boliaun in the field but
had a red garter, the very model of his own, tied about it; and as to
digging up the whole field, that was all nonsense, for there were more
than forty good Irish acres in it.</p>

<p>In such case he pushed on till in early forenoon he came to the sixth
island, with trees a-growing and rills a flowing, where he landed and
walked about, looking right and left, till he came to an apple tree
and put forth his hand to pluck of the fruit, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! one cried out
to him from the tree, saying, &#8217;An thou draw near to this tree and cut
of it aught, I will cut thee in twain.</p>

<p>And they were about to charge when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! a cloud of dust
rose high and walled the horizon-sky, when the wind smote it, so that
it spired aloft and spread pavilion-wise in the lift and there it
hung; and presently appeared beneath it the glint of helmet and gleam
of hauberk and splendid warriors, baldrick&#8217;d with their tempered
swords and holding in rest their supple spears.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when they had neatly picked out the fig with their teeth
from old Thacor&#8217;s snatch-blatch, they plainly showed it the headsman,
saying, Ecco <span class="lol">lol</span> fico, Behold the fig! By the same ignominy the rest of
these poor distressed Gaillardets saved their bacon, becoming
tributaries and slaves, and the name of Pope-figs was given them,
because they said, A fig for the pope&#8217;s image.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, <span class="lol">lol</span>, increasing lustre, torrid breath to the nostrils; <span class="lol">lol</span>, Torrid
brilliancies thro&#8217; the vapours lighten swifter, penetrate them, Fasten
merciless, ruminant, hueless, on earth&#8217;s frame crackling busily. He
aloft, the frenzied driver, in the glow of the universe, Like the
paling of the dawn-star withers visibly, he aloft: Bitter fury in his
aspect, bitter death in the heart of him.</p>

<p>I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold, he
takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden
stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and
striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous
scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this
is using Rogers&#8217;s best cutlery with a vengeance.</p>

<p>And bear this word away now, by thy faith, Touching such thing, <span class="lol">lol</span>,
what the wise man saith: &#8216;Within thy house be thou no lion; To thy
subjects do none oppression; Nor make thou thine acquaintance for to
flee. &#8217; And yet, Thomas, eftsoones* charge I thee, *again Beware from
ire that in thy bosom sleeps, Ware from the serpent, that so slily
creeps Under the grass, and stingeth subtilly.</p>

<p>Then they went their ways and I fell prostrate for weariness on the
ground where I stood; but as I lay, pondering my case <span class="lol">lol</span>! I heard a
Voice though I saw no one and the Voice versified with these two
couplets, &#8217;Let Fate with slackened bridle fare her pace, * Nor pass
the night with mind which cares an ace Between eye-closing and its
opening, * Allah can foulest change to fairest case.</p>

<p>Young Jamie <span class="lol">lol</span>&#8216;ed me weel, and sought me for his bride; But saving a
croun he had naething else beside: To make the croun a pund, young
Jamie gaed to sea; And the croun and the pund were baith for me. He
hadna been awa&#8217; a week but only twa, When my father brak his arm, and
the cow was stown awa; My mother she fell sick,--and my Jamie at the
sea-- And auld Robin Gray came a-courtin&#8217; me.</p>

<p>and <span class="lol">lol</span> a helm underneath the spear: tarry not, let us save our horses!
&#8220; Then Ralph let a cry out from his mouth, and set off running to the
side of the slope, and fell to climbing it with great strides, not
heeding Ursula; but she followed close after, and scrambled up with
foot and hand and knee, till she stood beside him on the top, and he
looked around wildly and cried out: &#8221;Where!</p>

<p>And while they were in this condition, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the knight their captain
said to those who counselled their slaughter, &quot;It is not for any save
for King Afridun to kill them, that he may gratify his wrath;
therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the
morrow, when we will journey with them to Constantinople and deliver
them to our King, who shall deal with them as he please.</p>

<p>Well now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks
the suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for
the boots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four
roubles fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they
were bought in the <span class="lol">lol</span>-- which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five
copecks. Forty-five copecks change in coppers.</p>

<p>36:6 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt;
whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is
Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him. 36:7 But if thou say

and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to
Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</p>

<p>CXLI To the north wind, which blew upon their right, Stretching to
seaward, they their sails untie: When <span class="lol">lol</span>! a south-south-wester, which
seemed light, In the beginning, while the sun was high, And afterwards
increased in force t&#8217;wards night, Raised up the sea against them
mountains high; With such dread flashes, and loud peals of thunder, As
Heaven, to swallow all in fire, would sunder.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, now is that come to pass which was foretold me long ago, but from
mine eyes has it been hidden, for none may fight against his fate and
prevail. Behold this has Brynhild brought to pass, even she who loves
me before all men; but this may I swear, that never have I wrought ill
to Gunnar, but rather have ever held fast to my oath with him, nor was
I ever too much a friend to his wife.</p>

<p>XII <span class="lol">Lol</span>, this is he in whom the surgent springs Of recollections richer

At the coming up of Phoebus the all-luminous charioteer, Double-

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, thus saith Arnold of the newe town, &lt;18&gt; As his Rosary maketh

<p>Now, when they had passed before the Chief Vizier and departed, <span class="lol">lol</span>! he
fell to laughing violently, so that his hair was agitated and was as a
sand-cloud over him, and his countenance behind it was as the sun of
the desert reflected ripplingly on the waters of a bubbling spring,
for it had the aspect of merriness; and the Chief Vizier exclaimed, &#8217;O
Shibli Bagarag, have I not made fair show?</p>

<p>And I had told but twenty years, and my heart had been mellowed in the
tender sunshine of a happy home, and I had loved this boy as a
stranger; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, he was Roland&#8217;s son! I forgot all else, looking upon
that anguish; and I threw myself on the ground by the form that
writhed there, and folding my arms round the breast which in vain
repelled me, I whispered, &quot;Comfort, comfort: life is long.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, suche sleightes and subtilities In women be; for aye as busy as

<p>1:51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
Solomon: for, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar,
saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his
servant with the sword. 1:52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself
a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if
wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</p>

<p>Then shall there be another blast on it, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! arising they shall

Lord, and the Book shall be set, and the prophets shall be brought up,

<p>As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil, The fishes draw to that
which from without Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;
So I beheld more than a thousand splendours Drawing towards us, and in
each was heard: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, this is she who shall increase our love. &#8221; And as
each one was coming unto us, Full of beatitude the shade was seen, By
the effulgence clear that issued from it.</p>

<p>This famous story began as an attempt to plead the cause of the
oppressed Indian, to do for him what _Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin_ was supposed
to have done for the negro; it ended in an idyllic story so well told
that readers forgot to cry, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, the poor Indian,&#8221; as the author
intended. At the present time _Ramona_ is not classed with the
problem-novels but with the most readable of American romances.</p>

<p>47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this
day and your land for Pharaoh: <span class="lol">lol</span>, here is seed for you, and ye shall
sow the land. 47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye
shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your
own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your
households, and for food for your little ones.</p>

<p>He took patience till midnight, when he arose and fared accompanied by
the headsman to the gaol that he might witness the strangling of
Attaf; but <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! he found the prison door wide open and the
keeper in sore sorrow with his raiment all rent to rags and his beard
plucked out and his face scratched and the blood trickling from his
four sides and his case was the miserablest of cases.</p>

<p>And Shibli Bagarag followed her, clutching at the trailers and tearing
them with him, letting loose a torrent of stones and earth, till on a
sudden they stood together above a greenswarded basin of the rock
opening to the sea; and in the middle of the basin, <span class="lol">lol</span>! in stature
like a maiden of the mountains, and one that droopeth her head
pensively thinking of her absent lover, the Enchanted Lily.</p>

<p>Then he looked up, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! behind a curtain, steps leading to an
anteroom, and beyond that a chamber like the chamber of kings where
they sit in state dispensing judgements, like the sun at noon in
splendour; and in the chamber seven youths, tall and comely young men,
calm as princes in their port, each one dressed in flowing robes, and
with a large glowing pearl in the front of their turbans.</p>

<p>No more as now of this matere, 190 For-why this folk wol comen up

<p>On the windy hills <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the little harebell leans On the spire-grass
that it queens, With bonnet blue; Trusting love instils Love and
subject reverence true; Learn what love instils On the hills! By the
bare wayside Placid snowdrops hang their cheeks, Softly touch&#8217;d with
pale green streaks, Soon, soon, to die; On the clothed hedgeside Bands
of rosy beauties vie, In their prophesied Summer pride.</p>

<p>The necessity for extreme caution, however, in dealing with &#8220;inward
spies,&#8221; appears from an historical incident related by Ho Shih: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>
Shang, Governor of I-Chou, sent his general Wei Po to attack the rebel
Li Hsiung of Shu in his stronghold at P`i. After each side had
experienced a number of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse
to the services of a certain P`o-t`ai, a native of Wu-tu.</p>

<p>He began to have him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him
off to <span class="lol">Lol</span> Shang, whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with
him from inside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right
moment for making a general assault. <span class="lol">Lol</span> Shang, confiding in these
promises, march out all his best troops, and placed Wei Po and others
at their head with orders to attack at P`o-t`ai&#8217;s bidding.</p>

<p>13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing
ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,
<span class="lol">lol</span>, we turn to the Gentiles. 13:47 For so hath the Lord commanded us,
saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou
shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>Pandare gan him thonke, and to him seyde, 1415 `<span class="lol">Lol</span>, sire, I have a
lady in this toun, That is my nece, and called is Criseyde, Which some
men wolden doon oppressioun, And wrongfully have hir possessioun:
Wherfor I of your lordship yow biseche 1420 To been our freend, with-
oute more speche. &#8217; Deiphebus him answerde, `O, is not this, That thow
spekest of to me thus straungely, Criseyda, my freend?</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, one while when I look on thee thou art my dear and sweet
child, as thou wert years agone, and I love thee dearly and finely;
and another while thou art a great and mighty man, and I fear thee; so
much greater thou seemest than we poor upland folk. &#8220; Then smiled
Ralph for love and happiness, and he said: &#8221;Father, I am thy child in
the house and at the board, and that is for thine helping.</p>

<p>I am like the high priest,&#8220; he said, &#8221;who has to administer the &#8216;water
of bitterness&#8217; to a woman who is held under the suspicion of adultery,
and when he approaches the woman with the cup, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he beholds his own
mother. And I, O Mother Zion, thought, when I was called to prophesy,
that I was appointed to proclaim prosperity and salvation to thee, but
now I see that my message forebodes thee evil.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, the Bride of Peleus gliding came Forth of the sea, like the
still breath of dawn, And suddenly was with the Argive throng Where
eager-faced they waited, some, that looked Soon to contend in that
great athlete-strife, And some, to joy in seeing the mighty strive.
Amidst that gathering Thetis sable-stoled Set down her prizes, and she
summoned forth Achaea&#8217;s champions: at her best they came.</p>

<p>[2] <span class="lol">Lol</span>-han, Arhat, Arahat, are all designations of the perfected Arya,
the disciple who has passed the different stages of the Noble Path, or
eightfold excellent way, who has conquered all passions, and is not to
be reborn again. Arhatship implies possession of certain supernatural
powers, and is not to be succeeded by Buddhaship, but implies the fact
of the saint having already attained nirvana.</p>

<p>When Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go straightway
to his mountains and his cave, but made many wanderings and
questionings, and ascertained this and that; so that he said of
himself jestingly: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, a river that floweth back unto its source in
many windings! &#8221; For he wanted to learn what had taken place AMONG MEN
during the interval: whether they had become greater or smaller.</p>

<p>Is much applauded and encouraged; goes out of the room as Swills;
comes in as the coroner (not the least in the world like him);
describes the inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte
accompaniment, to the refrain: With his (the coroner&#8217;s) tippy tol li
doll, tippy tol <span class="lol">lol</span> doll, tippy tol li doll, Dee! The jingling piano at
last is silent, and the Harmonic friends rally round their pillows.</p>

<p>There saw I play jongelours,* *jugglers &lt;37&gt; Magicians, and
tregetours,&lt;38&gt; And Pythonesses, &lt;39&gt; charmeresses, And old witches,
and sorceresses, That use exorcisations, And eke subfumigations; &lt;40&gt;
And clerkes* eke, which knowe well *scholars All this magic naturel,
That craftily do their intents, To make, in certain ascendents, &lt;41&gt;
Images, <span class="lol">lol</span>! through which magic To make a man be whole or sick.</p>

<p>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, here I lend thee this
sharp-pointed sword; Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, I lay it naked to the deadly
stroke, And humbly beg the death upon my knee, Nay, do not pause; for
I did kill King Henry,-- [He lays his breast open; she offers at it
with his sword. ] But &#8217;twas thy beauty that provoked me.</p>

<p>Now when they had washed him and shrouded him and carried him out upon
the bier, and were proceeding to the graveyard that they might bury
him, and had reached half way to it, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! I joined the
funeral train and suddenly walking under the coffin with a sharp
packing-needle[FN#337] in hand,--And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>So with many other Baconian essays: with &#8220;Love&#8221; for example, in which
we are told that it is impossible for a man to love and be wise; or
with &#8220;Negotiations,&#8221; which informs us that, unless a man intends to
use his letter to justify himself (<span class="lol">lol</span>! the politician), it is better
to deal by speech than by writing; for a man can &#8220;disavow or expound&#8221;
his speech, but his written word may be used against him.</p>

<p>In that horror of her dream she stood up suddenly, and thrust forth
her hands as to avert an evil, and advanced a step; and with the act
her dream was cloven and she awoke, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was sunrise; and where
had been two warriors of the Beni-Asser, were now five, and besides
her own steed five others, one the steed of Ruark, and Ruark with them
that watched over her: pale was the visage of the Chief.</p>

<p>IV <span class="lol">Lol</span>, as a tree, whose wintry twigs Drink in the sun with fibrous
joy, And down into its dampest roots Thrills quickened with the
draught of life, I wake unto the dawn, and leave my griefs to drowse.
I rise and drink the fresh sweet air: Each draught a future bud of
Spring; Each glance of blue a birth of green; I will not mimic yonder
oak That dallies with dead leaves ev&#8217;n while the primrose peeps.</p>

<p>And all this throve before I wedded thee, Believing, &#8220;<span class="lol">lol</span> mine
helpmate, one to feel My purpose and rejoicing in my joy. &#8221; Then came
thy shameful sin with Lancelot; Then came the sin of Tristram and
Isolt; Then others, following these my mightiest knights, And drawing
foul ensample from fair names, Sinned also, till the loathsome
opposite Of all my heart had destined did obtain, And all through
thee!</p>

<p>&#8220;He sat still on his saddle a while, staring at me and I at him; and
then he thanked me, but with so bad a grace, that I wondered of him if
he were angry; and then he shook his rein, and rode off briskly, and I
looked after him a while, and then went on my way; but I had gone but
a short while, when I heard horse-hoofs behind me, and I turned and
looked, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was the knight coming back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing this, Mashalleed charged against the Chief once more, and <span class="lol">lol</span>!
the Arabs opened to receive him, closing on his band of warriors like
waters whitened by the storm on a fleet of swift-scudding vessels: and
there was a dust and a tumult visible, such as is seen in the darkness
when a vessel struck by the lightning-bolt is sinking--flashes of
steel, lifting of hands, rolling of horsemen and horses.</p>

<p>In our interior the alarum-bells Of insurrection--peasantry in arms--
All orders discontented--and the army, Just in the moment of our
expectation Of aidance from it--<span class="lol">lol</span>! this very army Seduced, run wild,
lost to all discipline, Loosened, and rent asunder from the state And
from their sovereign, the blind instrument Of the most daring of
mankind, a weapon Of fearful power, which at his will he wields.</p>

<p>The weary- o&#8217;-the-world put it up, and the preachers of death and the
jailer: for <span class="lol">lol</span>, it is also a sermon for slavery:-- Because they
learned badly and not the best, and everything too early and
everything too fast; because they ATE badly: from thence hath resulted
their ruined stomach;-- --For a ruined stomach, is their spirit: IT
persuadeth to death! For verily, my brethren, the spirit IS a stomach!</p>

<p>And indeed he had drawn a knife to cut my throat when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold!
there came a mighty great crocodile forth of the river and snatching
him up from off my breast plunged into the water, with him still
hending knife in hand, even within the jaws of the beast: whilst I
abode extolling Almighty Allah, and rendering thanks for my
preservation to him who had delivered me from the hand of that wrong-
doer.</p>

<p>One evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the forest; and
when he sought for a well, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he lighted upon a green meadow
peacefully surrounded with trees and bushes, where maidens were
dancing together. As soon as the maidens recognised Zarathustra, they
ceased dancing; Zarathustra, however, approached them with friendly
mein and spake these words: Cease not your dancing, ye lovely maidens!</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came
swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind
him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the
sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless
lineage, fairest of her race. Little Alf Bergan popped in round the
door and hid behind Barney&#8217;s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.</p>

<p>In her hunger for his approach, she would at whiles pluck up the
herbage about her by the roots, and toss handfuls this way and that,
chiding the peaceful song of the nightbird in the leaves above her
head; and she was sinking with fretfulness, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! from the opening
arch of the glade a sudden light, and Bhanavar knew it for the Jewel
in the fingers of her betrothed, by the strength of its effulgence.</p>

<p>Twas so as it had long been, when suddenly, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a star from the upper
heaven that shot down between them wildly, and my star took lustre
from it; and the star of Shagpat trembled like a ring on a tightened
rope, and waved and flickered, and seemed to come forward and to
retire; and &#8217;twas presently as a comet in the sky, bright,--a tadpole,
with large head and lengthy tail, in the assembly of the planets.</p>

<p>7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; <span class="lol">lol</span>, he goeth out unto the
water; and thou shalt stand by the river&#8217;s brink against he come; and
the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.
7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in
the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.</p>

<p>9:6 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather
them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their
silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their
tabernacles. 9:7 The days of visitation are come, the days of
recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the
spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the
great hatred.</p>

<p>&lt;18&gt; <span class="lol">Lol</span> here, Andromache, Hectore&#8217;s wife, &lt;19&gt; That day that Hector
shoulde lose his life, She dreamed on the same night beforn, How that
the life of Hector should be lorn,* *lost If thilke day he went into
battaile; She warned him, but it might not avail; He wente forth to

all too long to tell; And eke it is nigh day, I may not dwell.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, the supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly Lamb of God,
no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no longer the Man of Sorrows, no
longer the Good Shepherd, He is seen now coming upon the clouds, in
great power and majesty, attended by nine choirs of angels, angels and
archangels, principalities, powers and virtues, thrones and
dominations, cherubim and seraphim, God Omnipotent, God Everlasting.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, I was now in my thirtieth year, sticking in the same mire,
greedy of enjoying things present, which passed away and wasted my
soul; while I said to myself, &quot;Tomorrow I shall find it; it will
appear manifestly and I shall grasp it; to, Faustus the Manichee will
come, and clear every thing! O you great men, ye Academicians, it is
true then, that no certainty can be attained for the ordering of life!</p>

<p>So she took the phial from him and led forth the Ass, and the twain
mounted the Ass and descended the slopes of the mountain in moonlight;
and Shibli Bagarag said, &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! I have marked wonders, and lived a life
since our parting; and this well, &#8217;tis a miracle to dip in it, and by
it sit many maidens weeping and old men babbling, and youths that were
idle youths striking bubbles from the surface of the water.</p>

<p>50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,
speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made
me swear, saying, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in
the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go
up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</p>

<p>The King bade him be seated; and, as soon as he sat down, began
telling his tale and said to him, &quot;I have dreamt this night a dream
which terrified me, and &#8217;twas, that methought I poured water upon the
roots of a tree where about were many other trees and as I was thus
engaged, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! fire issued therefrom and burnt up all the
growths that were around it; wherefore I was affrighted and fear took
me.</p>

<p>* *everywhere <span class="lol">Lol</span>, what said he, that so well teache can, &#8216;Be thou no
fellow to an irous man, Nor with no wood* man walke by the way,
*furious Lest thee repent;&#8217; I will no farther say. &quot;Now, Thomas, leve*
brother, leave thine ire, *dear Thou shalt me find as just as is as
squire; Hold not the devil&#8217;s knife aye at thine heaat; Thine anger
doth thee all too sore smart;* *pain But shew to me all thy
confession.</p>

<p>Then came from him sounds like the neighing of mares, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he
seized me and rose with me in the air, and I thought the very heavens
were opening to that black beast, when on a sudden he paused, and shot
down with me from heights of the stars to the mouth of a cavern by the
Putrid Sea, and dragged me into a cavern greatly illuminated, hung
like a palace chamber, and supported on pillars of shining jasper.</p>

<p>But scarce again his horn he wound, When <span class="lol">lol</span>! forth starting at the
sound, From underneath an aged oak That slanted from the islet rock, A
damsel guider of its way, A little skiff shot to the bay, That round
the promontory steep Led its deep line in graceful sweep, Eddying, in
almost viewless wave, The weeping willow twig to rave, And kiss, with
whispering sound and slow, The beach of pebbles bright as snow.</p>

<p>But now, O Atli, even as we die so shalt thou die; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, I alone wot
where the gold is, nor shall Hogni be to tell thereof now; to and fro
played the matter in my mind whiles we both lived, but now have I
myself determined for myself, and the Rhine river shall rule over the
gold, rather than that the Huns shall bear it on the hands of them. &#8220;
Then said King Atli, &#8221;Have away the bondsman;&quot; and so they did.</p>

<p>Replied she, &quot;Time is a term applied to the hours of the night and
day, which are but the measures of the courses of the sun and moon in
their several heavens, even as Allah Almighty telleth us when he
saith, &#8217;A sign to them also is the Night, from which we strip off the
day, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they are plunged in darkness, and the Sun runneth to her
place of rest; this is the ordinance of the Sublime, the All-knowing.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, but the breaking of a surge, And she is in her lover&#8217;s fold,
Illumined o&#8217;er a boundless range Anew: and through quick morning hours
The Tropic-Arctic countercharge Did seem to pant in beams and showers.
But noon beheld a larger heaven; Beheld on our reflecting field The
Sower to the Bearer given, And both their inner sweetest yield, Fresh
as when dews were grey or first Received the flush of hues athirst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Far be it from me,&#8221; said the cunning Bishop, &#8220;to point the way to one
so clear-sighted as Your Majesty; but, were I the King of England, I
should look upon the matter in this wise: I have promised my Queen,
let us say, that for forty days the cunningest rogue in all England
shall have freedom to come and go; but, <span class="lol">lol</span>! I find this outlaw in my
grasp; shall I, then, foolishly cling to a promise so hastily given?&#8221;</p>

<p>[117] When Esau observed that even his father&#8217;s love had passed from
him to Jacob, he went away, to Ishmael, and he addressed him as
follows: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, as thy father gave all his possessions to thy brother
Isaac, and dismissed thee with empty hands, so my father purposeth to
do to me. Make thyself ready then, go forth and slay thy brother, and
I will slay mine, and then we two shall divide the whole world between
us.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, where gleamed the sapphire lake, Leo, with his Rome at stake, Drew
blank air to hues and forms; Whereof Two that shone distinct, Linked
as orbed stars are linked, Clear among the myriad swarms, In a
constellation, dashed Full on horse and rider&#8217;s eyes Sunless light,
but light it was - Light that blinded and abashed, Froze his members,
bade him pause, Caught him mid-gallop, blazed him home. Attila, my
Attila!</p>

<p>And then behold a woman at a door Spinning; and fair the house whereby
she sat, And kind the woman&#8217;s eyes and innocent, And all her bearing
gracious; and she rose Opening her arms to meet me, as who should say,
&#8220;Rest here;&#8221; but when I touched her, <span class="lol">lol</span>! she, too, Fell into dust and
nothing, and the house Became no better than a broken shed, And in it
a dead babe; and also this Fell into dust, and I was left alone.</p>

<p>They halted forthright in the place they had reached, and Sharrkan
also halted and all righted there; and when Almighty Allah made
morning dawn, Sharrkan and his company and Abrizah and her company
took horse and fared on towards the city; when <span class="lol">lol</span>! on the way they met
the Wazir Dandan, who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour
Abrizah and Sharrkan, by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al-
Nu&#8217;uman.</p>

<p>To begin: there&#8217;s Aries, or the Ram-- lecherous dog, he begets us;
then, Taurus, or the Bull-- he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,
or the Twins-- that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when
<span class="lol">lol</span>! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from
Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path-- he gives a few fierce
bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the
Virgin!</p>

<p>And behold, Sharrkan and his men charged down upon the Infidels and
cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks; when
<span class="lol">lol</span>! a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of
Unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the Deniers,
cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks,
so that the Faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge
and hew.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, irous Cyrus, thilke* Persian, *that How he destroy&#8217;d the river of
Gisen,&lt;21&gt; For that a horse of his was drowned therein, When that he
wente Babylon to win: He made that the river was so small, That women
mighte wade it *over all. * *everywhere <span class="lol">Lol</span>, what said he, that so well
teache can, &#8216;Be thou no fellow to an irous man, Nor with no wood* man
walke by the way, *furious Lest thee repent;&#8217; I will no farther say.</p>

<p>And therewithal one came and seized on her, And Enid started waking,
with her heart All overshadowed by the foolish dream, And <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was
her mother grasping her To get her well awake; and in her hand A suit
of bright apparel, which she laid Flat on the couch, and spoke
exultingly: &#8217;See here, my child, how fresh the colours look, How fast
they hold like colours of a shell That keeps the wear and polish of
the wave.</p>

<p>[256] He said, and, entering, took his seat of state; Where full
before him reverend Priam sate; To whom, composed, the godlike chief
begun: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>! to thy prayer restored, thy breathless son; Extended on
the funeral couch he lies; And soon as morning paints the eastern
skies, The sight is granted to thy longing eyes: But now the peaceful
hours of sacred night Demand reflection, and to rest invite: Nor thou,
O father!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, ere I can repeat this curse again, Within so small a time, my
woman&#8217;s heart Grossly grew captive to his honey words, And prov&#8217;d the
subject of mine own soul&#8217;s curse,-- Which hitherto hath held my eyes
from rest; For never yet one hour in his bed Did I enjoy the golden
dew of sleep, But with his timorous dreams was still awak&#8217;d. Besides,
he hates me for my father Warwick; And will, no doubt, shortly be rid
of me.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, there was I received by the scourge of bodily sickness, and I
was going down to hell, carrying all the sins which I had committed,
both against Thee, and myself, and others, many and grievous, over and
above that bond of original sin, whereby we all die in Adam. For Thou
hadst not forgiven me any of these things in Christ, nor had He
abolished by His Cross the enmity which by my sins I had incurred with
Thee.</p>

<p>The warm touch of a soft and tremulous hand Wakened me then; <span class="lol">lol</span>!
Cythna sate reclined Beside me, on the waved and golden sand _4605 Of
a clear pool, upon a bank o&#8217;ertwined With strange and star-bright
flowers, which to the wind Breathed divine odour; high above, was
spread The emerald heaven of trees of unknown kind, Whose moonlike
blooms and bright fruit overhead _4610 A shadow, which was light, upon
the waters shed.</p>

<p>This is generally done by a squaw, who takes pinole in her blanket,
repairs to the scene of the incremation, or to places hallowed by the
memory of the dead, where she scatters it over the ground, meantime
rocking her body violently to and fro in a dance and chanting the
following chorus: Hel-lel-li-ly, Hel-lel-<span class="lol">lol</span>, Hel-lel-lu. &quot;This refrain
is repeated over and over indefinitely, but the words have no meaning
whatever.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, as they sped on, a deep gulf of the sea was opened, and <span class="lol">lol</span>,
the steep crags of the Caucasian mountains rose up, where, with his
limbs bound upon the hard rocks by galling fetters of bronze,
Prometheus fed with his liver an eagle that ever rushed back to its
prey. High above the ship at even they saw it flying with a loud
whirr, near the clouds; and yet it shook all the sails with the
fanning of those huge wings.</p>

<p>Her spirit returned not to her till the crescent of the moon was
yellow to its fall; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the youth was sighing heavy sighs and
leaning to the ground on one elbow, and she flung herself by him on
the ground, seeking for herbs that were antidotes to the poison of the
serpent, grovelling among the grasses and strewn leaves of the wood,
peering at them tearfully by the pale beams, and startling the insects
as she moved.</p>

<p>15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 15:13 And he said
unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
land that is not their&#8217;s, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict
them four hundred years; 15:14 And also that nation, whom they shall
serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great
substance.</p>

<p>14:10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these
forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses,
while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, <span class="lol">lol</span>,
I am this day fourscore and five years old. 14:11 As yet I am as
strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength
was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to
come in.</p>

<p>But in the ideal realm, aloof and far, Where the calm art&#8217;s pure
dwellers are, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the Laocoon writhes, but does not groan. Here, no
sharp grief the high emotion knows-- Here, suffering&#8217;s self is made
divine, and shows The brave resolve of the firm soul alone: Here,
lovely as the rainbow on the dew Of the spent thunder-cloud, to art is
given, Gleaming through grief&#8217;s dark veil, the peaceful blue Of the
sweet moral heaven.</p>

<p>42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, it
is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,
saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? 42:29
And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and
told him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the
lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the
country.</p>

<p>{1} Tom stared at the tranquil boy, observing to himself, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, it is a
wonderful thing,--a most strange and curious trade; I marvel they have
not hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for me--would
heaven they would!--an&#8217; they will do this thing, I will take my
lashings in mine own person, giving God thanks for the change. &#8221; Then
he said aloud-- &quot;And hast thou been beaten, poor friend, according to
the promise?</p>

<p>15:29 And he answering said to his father, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, these many years do I
serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and
yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my
friends: 15:30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath
devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
calf. 15:31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all
that I have is thine.</p>

<p>But they are all dispersed--and, <span class="lol">lol</span>! she stands Looking in idle grief
on her white hands, Alone within the garden now her own; _40 And
through the sunny air, with jangling tone, The music of the merry
marriage-bells, Killing the azure silence, sinks and swells;--
Absorbed like one within a dream who dreams That he is dreaming, until
slumber seems _45 A mockery of itself--when suddenly Antonio stood
before her, pale as she.</p>

<p>The following is the translation of M. Renan:-- &quot;In the month of Bul
(October), in the fourteenth year of the reign of King Esmunazar, king
of the Sidonians, son of King Tabnit, king of the Sidonians, King
Esmunazar, king of the Sidonians, spake, saying--I am snatched away
before my time, the child of a few days, the orphan son of a widow;
and <span class="lol">lol</span>! I am lying in this coffin, and in this tomb, in the place
which I have built.</p>

<p>As the young olive, in some sylvan scene, Crown&#8217;d by fresh fountains
with eternal green, Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair, And
plays and dances to the gentle air; When <span class="lol">lol</span>! a whirlwind from high
heaven invades The tender plant, and withers all its shades; It lies
uprooted from its genial bed, A lovely ruin now defaced and dead: Thus
young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay, While the fierce Spartan tore
his arms away.</p>

<p>Hogni answers, &#8220;A marvel is it to me of his bidding, for seldom hath
he done in such a wise, and ill counselled will it be to wend to him;
<span class="lol">lol</span> now, when I saw those dear-bought things the king sends us I
wondered to behold a wolfs hair knit to a certain gold ring; belike
Gudrun deems him to be minded as a wolf towards us, and will have
naught of our faring. &#8221; But withal Vingi shows him the runes which he
said Gudrun had sent.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, said she, seest thou yonder pavilion that is all of the colour of
Inde, and all manner of thing that there is about, men and women, and
horses trapped, shields and spears were all of the colour of Inde, and
his name is Sir Persant of Inde, the most lordliest knight that ever
thou lookedst on. It may well be, said Beaumains, but be he never so
stout a knight, in this field I shall abide till that I see him under
his shield.</p>

<p>Now, while he lounged and strolled, and was abusing the old woman, he
looked before him, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, one lolling in his shop-front, and people
standing outside the shop, marking him with admiration and reverence,
and pointing him out to each other with approving gestures. He who
lolled there was indeed a miracle of hairiness, black with hair as he
had been muzzled with it, and his head as it were a berry in a bush by
reason of it.</p>

<p>_165 And, as the effect pursues the cause foregone, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, giving
substance to my words, behold At once the sign and the thing
signified-- A troop of cripples, beggars, and lean outcasts, Horsed
upon stumbling jades, carted with dung, _170 Dragged for a day from
cellars and low cabins And rotten hiding-holes, to point the moral Of
this presentment, and bring up the rear Of painted pomp with misery!
NOTES: _162 her 1870; its 1824.</p>

<p>Sigurd answered, &#8220;Good friend, hearken to what lies on my mind; for my
hawk flew up into a certain tower; and when I came thereto and took
him, <span class="lol">lol</span> there I saw a fair woman, and she sat by a needlework of gold,
and did thereon, my deeds that are passed, and my deeds that are to
come,&#8221; Then said Alswid, &#8220;Thou has seen Brynhild, Budli&#8217;s daughter,
the greatest of great women. &#8221; &#8220;Yea, verily,&#8221; said Sigurd; &quot;but how
came she hither?</p>

<p>CII IT pleased God, who rules all things for our good--I mean, for
those who acknowledge and believe in Him; such men never fail to gain
His protection--that about this time a certain rascal from Vecchio
called Piermaria d’Anterigoli, and surnamed <span class="lol">Lol</span> Sbietta, introduced
himself to me. He is a sheep-grazier; and being closely related to
Messer Guido Guidi, the physician, who is now provost of Pescia, I
lent ear to his proposals.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, the gardener is now become the commander of a fortress! The soul
will do nothing but the will of our Lord; it will not act as the owner
even of itself, nor of anything, not even of a single apple in the
orchard; only, if there be any good thing in the garden, it is at His
Majesty&#8217;s disposal; for from henceforth the soul will have nothing of
its own,--all it seeks is to do everything for His glory, and
according to His will.</p>

<p>When on my foes a sudden terror came, And they fled, scattering--<span class="lol">lol</span>!
with reinless speed A black Tartarian horse of giant frame Comes
trampling over the dead, the living bleed _2500 Beneath the hoofs of
that tremendous steed, On which, like to an Angel, robed in white,
Sate one waving a sword;--the hosts recede And fly, as through their
ranks with awful might, Sweeps in the shadow of eve that Phantom swift
and bright; _2505 20.</p>

<p>However she found on a hill-flank some remnants of the late rain which
she drank; then, loosing the girths of her horse she gave him also to
drink and she was about to take her rest in that place when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold! a lion big of bulk and mighty of might drew near her and he
was lashing his tail[FN#200] and roaring thunderously.--And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<p>21:23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the
king do that which is good in his eyes: <span class="lol">lol</span>, I give thee the oxen also
for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the
wheat for the meat offering; I give it all. 21:24 And king David said
to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will
not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings
without cost.</p>

<p>6:12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, there
was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair,
and the moon became as blood; 6:13 And the stars of heaven fell unto
the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is
shaken of a mighty wind. 6:14 And the heaven departed as a scroll when
it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of
their places.</p>

<p>It is because of such lines, the care with which the whole poem is
polished, and the occasional appearance of real beauty (such as the
passage beginning, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, the poor Indian&#8221;) that the _Essay on Man_
occupies such a high place in eighteenth-century literature.
[Sidenote: THE QUALITY OF POPE] It is hardly necessary to examine
other works of Pope, since the poems already named give us the full
measure of his strength and weakness.</p>

<p>Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn, That sent the face of
all the marsh aloft An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud Of shriek
and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all, Even to tipmost lance and
topmost helm, In blood-red armour sallying, howled to the King, &#8217;The
teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!-- <span class="lol">Lol</span>! art thou not that
eunuch-hearted King Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world--
The woman-worshipper?</p>

<p>Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line; and then was
rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again-- hoping that way to
disencumber it of some snarls--when <span class="lol">lol</span>!-- a sight more savage than the
embattled teeth of sharks! Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the
mazes of the line, loose harpoons and lances, with all their bristling
barbs and points, came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the
bows of Ahab&#8217;s boat.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> now, how meet would it be for thee to behold thy brother Atli slain
before thine eyes, and that thou shouldst stand over him dead; whereas
we must needs now stand over our brother-in-law in such a case our
brother-in-law and our brother&#8217;s bane. &#8220; She answered, &#8221;None need mock
at the measure of slaughter being unfulfilled; yet heedeth not Atli
your wrath or your threats; yea, he shall live longer than ye, and be
a mightier man.</p>

<p>The sight nearly took his breath away!--He stood gazing at the fair
young face like one transfixed; then presently ejaculated-- &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, the
Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his throne! &#8221; He muttered
some broken sentences, still gazing and marvelling; then turned his
eyes around and about, scanning the gorgeous throng and the splendid
saloon, murmuring, &quot;But these are REAL--verily these are REAL-- surely
it is not a dream.</p>

<p>When it was the Nine Hundredth Night, She continued: It hath reached
me, O auspicious King, that the King saw himself in his vision pouring
water upon the roots of a tree, about which were many other trees; and
<span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! there came fire out of this tree and burnt up every
growth which encompassed it; whereupon Jali&#8217;ad awoke affrighted and
trembling, and calling one of his pages said to him, &quot;Go fetch the
Wazir Shimas in all haste.</p>

<p>When <span class="lol">lol</span>! the deeps arise, the tempests roar, And drive the hero to the
Coan shore: Great Jove, awaking, shook the blest abodes With rising
wrath, and tumbled gods on gods; Me chief he sought, and from the
realms on high Had hurl&#8217;d indignant to the nether sky, But gentle
Night, to whom I fled for aid, (The friend of earth and heaven,) her
wings display&#8217;d; Impower&#8217;d the wrath of gods and men to tame, Even
Jove revered the venerable dame.</p>

<p>And be ye turned to Him, and fear Him, and observe prayer, and be not
of those who unite gods with God: Of those who have split up their
religion, and have become sects, where every party rejoices in what is
their own.9 When some evil toucheth men, they turn to their Lord and
call upon him: then when he hath made them taste his mercy, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a part
of them join other gods with their Lord, Ungrateful for our favours!
Enjoy yourselves then.</p>

<p>So Ralph set his hand to the knop and drew strongly, and <span class="lol">lol</span> it was a
door made of a squared stone hung on brazen hinges, and it opened
easily to him, and within was a cup of goldsmith&#8217;s work, with the
sword and the bough done thereon; and round about the rim writ this
posey: &#8220;THE STRONG OF HEART SHALL DRINK FROM ME. &#8221; So Ralph took it
and held it aloft so that its pure metal flashed in the sun, and he
said: &quot;This is for thee, Sweetling.</p>

<p>Upward to this starry height The culminating seasons rolled; On one
slope green with spring delight, The other with harvest gold, And
treasures of Autumn untold: And on this highest throne of the
midsummer now The waning but deathless day doth dream, With a
rapturous grace, as tho&#8217; from the face Of the unveiled infinity, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a
far beam Had fall&#8217;n on her dim-flushed brow! Prolong, prolong that
tide of song, O leafy nightingale and thrush!</p>

<p>4:15 Then he said unto me, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, I have given thee cow&#8217;s dung for man&#8217;s
dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. 4:16 Moreover he
said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in
Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they
shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment: 4:17 That they
may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and
consume away for their iniquity.</p>

<p>For as he was walking up and down by himself before the judgment-seat,
with his note-book and pen, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a young man, a lawyer, the real thief,
privily bringing a hatchet, got in, unperceived by Alypius, as far as
the leaden gratings which fence in the silversmiths&#8217; shops, and began
to cut away the lead. But the noise of the hatchet being heard, the
silversmiths beneath began to make a stir, and sent to apprehend
whomever they should find.</p>

<p>So she took the lute and tuning it, sang the following verses: <span class="lol">Lol</span>,
since the day I left you, O my masters, Life is not sweet, no aye my
heart is light. Yea, in the night the thought of you still slays me;
Hidden are my traces from the wise men&#8217;s sight, All for a wild deer&#8217;s
love, whose looks have snared me And on whose brows the morning
glitters bright I am become, for severance from my loved one, Like a
left hand, forsaken of the right.</p>

<p>Lingering there a moment, the eye resumed its climbing, going next to
the Gentiles&#8217; Court, then to the Israelites&#8217; Court, then to the
Women&#8217;s Court, then to the Court of the Priests, each a pillared tier
of white marble, one above the other in terraced retrocession; over
them all a crown of crowns infinitely sacred, infinitely beautiful,
majestic in proportions, effulgent with beaten gold--<span class="lol">lol</span>! the Tent, the
Tabernacle, the Holy of Holies.</p>

<p>In 1769, for example, when the whole musical establishment of Esterhaz
visited Vienna, a performance of his opera, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> Speciale,&#8221; was given
at the house of Freiherr von Sommerau, and was repeated in the form of
a concert. Other works of the kind were performed at intervals,
particularly on festival occasions, but as most of them have perished,
and all of them are essentially pieces d&#8217;occasion, it is unnecessary
even to recall their names.</p>

<p>7:6 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of
chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and
they said one to another, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the king of Israel hath hired against us
the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come
upon us. 7:7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left
their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it
was, and fled for their life.</p>

<p>1 Nephi 21:12 12 And then, O house of Israel, behold, these shall come
from far; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, these from the north and from the west; and these
from the land of Sinim. 1 Nephi 21:13 13 Sing, O heavens; and be
joyful, O earth; for the feet of those who are in the east shall be
established; and break forth into singing, O mountains; for they shall
be smitten no more; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will
have mercy upon his afflicted.</p>

<p>24:11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee
unto great honour; but, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.
24:12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
which thou sentest unto me, saying, 24:13 If Balak would give me his
house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of
the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD
saith, that will I speak?</p>

<p>When it was the One Hundred and Twenty-second Night, She said, It hath
reached me, O auspicious King, that the young merchant, whose name was
Aziz, continued to Taj al-Muluk:--And when I entered the street called
Syndic Street behold, I caught sight of an old woman walking with a
lighted taper in one hand and in the other a folded letter and I drew
near her and <span class="lol">lol</span>! she was weeping and repeating these couplets, &quot;O glad
news bearer well come!</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> Croesus, which that was of Lydia king, Mette he not that he sat
upon a tree, Which signified he shoulde hanged be? &lt;18&gt; <span class="lol">Lol</span> here,
Andromache, Hectore&#8217;s wife, &lt;19&gt; That day that Hector shoulde lose his
life, She dreamed on the same night beforn, How that the life of
Hector should be lorn,* *lost If thilke day he went into battaile; She
warned him, but it might not avail; He wente forth to fighte
natheless, And was y-slain anon of Achilles.</p>

<p>But when the force of flame was burning low, Then did they drench the
pyre with ruddy wine, And the white bones of Corythus bestow Within a
gold cruse, wrought with many a sign, And wrapp&#8217;d the cruse about with
linen fine And bare it to the tomb: when, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the wild OEnone sprang,
with burning eyes divine, And shriek&#8217;d unto the slayer of her child:
XLIV. &quot;Oh Thou, that like a God art sire and slayer, That like a God,
dost give and take away!</p>

<p>Their interest is drawn away to another of Zeus&#8217; victims, who at this
moment rushes on the scene; it is <span class="lol">lol</span>, cajoled and abandoned by Zeus,
plagued and tormented by the dread unsleeping gadfly sent by Zeus&#8217;
consort Hera. She relates her story to the wondering Chorus, and then
Prometheus tells her the long tale of misery and wandering that await
her as she passes from the Caucasus to Egypt, where she is promised
deliverance from her tormentor.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, the poor Indian! whose untutored mind Sees God in clouds, or hears
Him in the wind; His soul, proud science never taught to stray Far as
the solar walk, or milky way; Yet simple Nature to his hope has given,
Behind the cloud-topped hill, an humbler heaven; Some safer world in
depth of woods embraced, Some happier island in the watery waste,
Where slaves once more their native land behold, No fiends torment, no
Christians thirst for gold.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, now, the greatness and the happiness thou art losing for this idle
vanity is to be as a dunghill cock matched with an ostrich; and think
not to escape the calamities thou bringest on thyself, for as is said,
No runner can outstrip his fate; and it will overtake thee, though
thou part like an arrow from the bow. &#8217; He still made a jest of her
remonstrance, trying the temper of the animal, and rejoicing in its
dark flushes of ireful vigour.</p>

<p>All the same, while smarting, he began to cry: “<span class="lol">Lol</span>! my lord, a
faithful servant of his prince, who tries to act rightly, and is
willing to put up with any sort of bad treatment, provided only that
poor lady have her heart’s desire!” The Duke tired of the ribald
fellow, either to recompense the cuffs which he had dealt him, or for
the Duchess’ sake, whom he was ever most inclined to gratify, cried
out: “Get away with you, with God’s curse on you!</p>

<p>She signed imperiously to some slaves to stay his right wrist, and
they seized on it; but not all of them together could withhold him
from dropping a drop into the petals of the flower, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, the Lily
spake, a voice from it like the voice of Noorna, saying, &#8216;Remember the
Seventh Pillar. &#8217; Thereat, he lifted his eyes to his brows and frowned
back memory to his aid, and the scene of Karaz, Rabesqurat, Abarak,
and his betrothed was present to him.</p>

<p>From Tara next The news: &quot;Laeghaire, the King, sits close in cloud Of
sullen thought, or storms from court to court, Because the chiefest of
the Druid race Locru, and Luchat prophesied long since That one day
from the sea a Priest would come With Doctrine and a Rite, and dash to
earth Idols, and hurl great monarchs from their thrones; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! At
Imber Boindi late there stept A priest from roaring waves with Creed
and Rite, And men before him bow.</p>

<p>But, as soon as the power that any one of Odette&#8217;s sentences had to
make Swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold
another, one of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention,
almost a new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him
with undiminished force. The memory of the evening on which he had
dined with the Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was no
more than the centre, the core of his pain.</p>

<p>He continued to keep him company till, one day, as he sat in the
Divan, according to his custom attending upon the Caliph, <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold! an Emir came up with sword and shield in hand and said, &#8220;O
Commander of the Faithful, may thy head long outlive the Head of the
Sixty, for he is dead this day;&#8221; whereupon the Caliph ordered Ala al-
Din a dress of honour and made him Chief of the Sixty, in place of the
other who had neither wife nor son nor daughter.</p>

<p>Vnder the coole shade of a Siccamore, I thought to close mine eyes
some halfe an houre: When <span class="lol">lol</span> to interrupt my purpos&#8217;d rest, Toward

I stole into a neighbour thicket by, And ouer-heard, what you shall

Action and accent did they teach him there.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, Baba Mustapha worked diligently, and Shagpat was behind an
exulting lather, even as one pelted with wheaten flour-balls or balls
of powdery perfume, and his hairiness was as branches of the forest
foliage bent under a sudden fall of overwhelming snow that filleth the
pits and sharpeneth the wolves with hunger, and teacheth new cunning
to the fox. A fox was Baba Mustapha in his stratagems, and a wolf in
the fierceness of his setting upon Shagpat.</p>

<p>19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
stood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,
and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the smoke
of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. 19:29 And it came to
pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered
Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he
overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.</p>

<p>As he made an end of his recitation, he found himself walking adown in
Zayn al-Mawasif&#8217;s street and smelt the sweet savour of the pastiles
wherewithal she had incensed the house; wherefore his vitals fluttered
and his heart was like to leave his breast and desire flamed up in him
and distraction redoubled upon him; when <span class="lol">lol</span>, and behold! Hubub, on her
way to do her lady&#8217;s errand suddenly appeared at the head of the
street and he rejoiced with joy exceeding.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, as he held the Lily to light him on, and the light of the Lily
fell on them that were asleep, they paled and shrank, and were such as
the death-chill maketh of us. So he called upon his head the
protection of Allah, and went swifter, to chase from his limbs the
shudder of awe; and there were some that slept not, but stared at him
with fixed eyes, eyes frozen by the light of the Lily, and he shunned
those, for they were like spectres, haunting spirits.</p>

<p>He then again exerted himself, and they succeeded in crossing to the
south of the range, and arrived in the kingdom of <span class="lol">Lol</span>-e,[5] where there
were nearly three thousand monks, students of both the mahayana and
hinayana. Here they stayed for the summer retreat,[6] and when that
was over, they went on to the south, and ten days&#8217; journey brought
them to the kingdom of Poh-na,[7] where there are also more than three
thousand monks, all students of the hinayana.</p>

<p>Mosiah 3:7 7 And <span class="lol">lol</span>, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body,
hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it
be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great
shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his
people. Mosiah 3:8 8 And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from
the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</p>

<p>(she is not my daughter, but my brother&#8217;s,) there is a man, and a
brisk lad too, whom she calleth her batchelor, and is as I verily deem
well-pleased with him: yet <span class="lol">lol</span> you how she eyeth thee, thou fair man,
and doth so with her raiment that thou mayst best see how shapely she
is of limb and foot, and toyeth her right hand with her left wrist,
and the like.--Well, as for me, I have had more lovers than one or
two. And why have I had just so many and no more?</p>

<p>1:15 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every
one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against
all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of
Judah. 1:16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all
their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</p>

<p>23:13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and
the rulers and the people, 23:14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this
man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having
examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching
those things whereof ye accuse him: 23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I
sent you to him; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good,&#8221; said Ralph laughing, &#8220;yet the oak-tree hath not spoken
yet, despite of all thy kissing: and <span class="lol">lol</span> there goes thy friend the
robin, now thou hast no more meat to give him. &#8221; &#8220;He is flying towards
the Well at the World&#8217;s End,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and biddeth us onward: let us

blind and tremulous wall of cliff Tormented by sea surge, he leans his

torrent-cloven abyss, If falling flood might lisp it!</p>

<p>Mosiah 3:9 9 And <span class="lol">lol</span>, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come
unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even
after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a
devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him. Mosiah 3:10 10
And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth
to judge the world; and behold, all these things are done that a
righteous judgment might come upon the children of men.</p>

<p>A glance that dealt love-sickness dealt me death, * Glances are
deadliest things with torments rare: He shook his love locks down and
bared his chin, * Whereby I spied his beauties dark and fair: My care,
my cure are in his hands; and he * Who caused their dolour can their
dole repair: His belt went daft for softness of his waist; * His hips,
for envy, to uprise forbear: His brow curl-diademed is murky night; *
Unveil &#8217;t and <span class="lol">lol</span>! bright Morn shows brightest light.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, in our midst Be many spear-won Trojans, thralls of Fate; And these

Wiser than thou, of Danaans young or old, In that thou say&#8217;st that
unforgiving wrath Will burn in him to whom the Gods herein Deny the

<p>She could not get his meaning into her sight, and she sought, by
looking hard, to understand it better; much as when some solitary
maiden lady, passing into her bedchamber in the hours of darkness,
beholds--tradition telling us she has absolutely beheld foot of
burglar under bed; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! she stares, and, cunningly to moderate her
horror, doubts, yet cannot but believe that there is a leg, and a
trunk, and a head, and two terrible arms, bearing pistols, to follow.</p>

<p>8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
stand before Pharaoh; <span class="lol">lol</span>, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto
him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,
and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of
swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.</p>

<p>7:13 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a
cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a
tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay
along. 7:14 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else
save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into
his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, this was all the sentence of the bill. Virginius gan upon the
clerk behold; But hastily, ere he his tale told, And would have proved
it, as should a knight, And eke by witnessing of many a wight, That
all was false that said his adversary, This cursed judge would no
longer tarry, Nor hear a word more of Virginius, But gave his
judgement, and saide thus: &quot;I deem* anon this clerk his servant have;
*pronounce, determine Thou shalt no longer in thy house her save.</p>

<p>Now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a whole year
had sped since ye were lost to his sight, <span class="lol">lol</span>! there came to us an
ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied by five
damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with such beauty and
loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, to crown their
perfections of comeliness, they could read the Koran and were versed
in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples.</p>

<p>He smiled therewith, but now Ralph deemed him not so debonnaire as he
had at first, for there was mocking in the smile; therefore he was
wroth, but he refrained him and said: &#8220;Sir Minstrel, I wot not why
thou hast come with a tale in thy mouth and it will not out of it: <span class="lol">lol</span>
you, will this open the doors of speech to thee&#8221; (and he reached his
hand out to him with two pieces of gold lying therein) &#8220;or shall this?
&#8221; and therewith he half drew his sword from his sheath.</p>

<p>Til at the last this sorwful wight Criseyde To Troilus these ilke

<p>Then he went up to the throne; but, as he drew near unto it <span class="lol">lol</span>&#8217; c
mighty serpent came forth from beneath it and cried out at him with so
terrible a cry that the whole place trembled and sparks flew from its
mouth, saying, &#8216;Begone, or thou art a dead man&#8217; But Affan busied
himself with his incantations and suffered himself not to be startled
thereby. Then the serpent blew such a fiery blast at him, that the
place was like to be set on fire, and said to him, Woe to thee!</p>

<p>To relieve an uncertainty in Cecilia&#8217;s face, that might soon have
become confusion, he described the downs fronting the paleness of
earliest dawn, and then their arch and curve and dip against the
pearly grey of the half-glow; and then, among their hollows, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the
illumination of the East all around, and up and away, and a gallop for
miles along the turfy thymy rolling billows, land to left, sea to
right, below you. &#8217;It&#8217;s the nearest hit to wings we can make, Cecilia.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, a wrestler, not a God, stood in the chariot ever lowering: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the
shape of one who raced there to outstrip the legitimate hours: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the

Light of days of happy pipings by the mead-singing rivulets! <span class="lol">Lol</span>, <span class="lol">lol</span>,

<p>Now, when I was in my chamber, what saw I there but a dress of very
costly blue raiment with gold-work broidery and a lovely circlet of
gold, and gold bracelets set with stones of turquoise, and a basket of
gold woven wire, wherein were toys, wondrous ones--soldiers that cut
off each other&#8217;s heads and put them on again, springing antelopes,
palm-trees that turned to fountains, and others; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a book in red
binding, with figures on it and clasps of gold, a great book!</p>

<p>13:10 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,
Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>,
others daubed it with untempered morter: 13:11 Say unto them which
daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an
overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a
stormy wind shall rend it. 13:12 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, when the wall is fallen, shall it
not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed

<p>7:6 After this I beheld, and <span class="lol">lol</span> another, like a leopard, which had
upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four
heads; and dominion was given to it. 7:7 After this I saw in the night
visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong
exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in
pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was
diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, thy hawks pine now, and thy horse Grani droops; and long will it

when I came thereto and took him, <span class="lol">lol</span> there I saw a fair woman, and she
sat by a needlework of gold, and did thereon, my deeds that are
passed, and my deeds that are to come,&#8220; Then said Alswid, &#8221;Thou has

<p>CHAPTER 11 Now Must Ralph Ride For It When he awoke again the sun was
shining through the hazel leaves, though it was yet early; he arose
and looked to his horse, and led him out of the hazel copse and stood
and looked about him; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a man coming slowly through the wood on
Ralph&#8217;s right hand, and making as it seemed for the want-way; he saw
Ralph presently, and stopped, and bent a bow which he held in his

<p>17:17 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company

cut off many persons: 17:18 Seeing he despised the oath by breaking
the covenant, when, <span class="lol">lol</span>, he had given his hand, and hath done all these
things, he shall not escape. 17:19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;
As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant

heaven, if I fall into Aeetes&#8217; hands and am slain with grievous

<p>10:28 Then Peter began to say unto him, <span class="lol">Lol</span>, we have left all, and have

<p>By this; lamenting Philomel had ended The well-tun&#8217;d warble of her
nightly sorrow, And solemn night with slow-sad gait descended To ugly
hell; when, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the blushing morrow Lends light to all fair eyes that
light will borrow: But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see, And
therefore still in night would cloister&#8217;d be. Revealing day through
every cranny spies, And seems to point her out where she sits weeping,
To whom she sobbing speaks: &#8217;O eye of eyes, Why pryest thou through my
window?</p>

<p>CANTO XXVIII So she who doth imparadise my soul, Had drawn the veil
from off our pleasant life, And bar&#8217;d the truth of poor mortality;
When <span class="lol">lol</span>! as one who, in a mirror, spies The shining of a flambeau at
his back, Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach, And turneth to
resolve him, if the glass Have told him true, and sees the record
faithful As note is to its metre; even thus, I well remember, did
befall to me, Looking upon the beauteous eyes, whence love Had made
the leash to take me.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> now, there perishes a righteous offspring, who had the heart to
fight with savage spears; brothers born of a shining race charge and
bring death on one another; while they long for the height of power,
they lose their days, and, having now received a fatal mischief in
their desire for a sceptre, they will go to Styx in a common death.
Fast by my head stands my Swedish shield, which is adorned with (as) a
fresh mirror of diverse chasing, and ringed with layers of marvellous
fretwork.</p>

<p>When he had performed this ceremony a space, the King called, and a
basin of water was brought to him, and handed round by slaves, and all
dipped in it their hands, and renewed their countenances and re-
arranged their limbs; and the Hall brightened with the eye of the
King, and he cried, &#8217;O people, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the plot is revealed to me, and
&#8217;tis a deep one; but, by this beard, we&#8217;ll strike at the root of it,
and a blow of deadliness. Surely we have humiliated ourselves, and
vengeance is ours!</p>

<p>1430 Quod Pandarus; `If ye, my lord so dere, Wolden as now don this

<p>If we admit the justice of Bacon&#8217;s censure, we admit it with regret,
similar to that which Dante felt when he learned the fate of those
illustrious heathens who were doomed to the first circle of Hell:
&#8220;Gran duol mi prese al cuor quando <span class="lol">lol</span> &#8217;ntesi, Perocche gente di molto
valore Conobbi che &#8217;n quel limbo eran sospesi. &#8221; But in truth the very
admiration which we feel for the eminent philosophers of antiquity
forces us to adopt the opinion that their powers were systematically
misdirected.</p>

<p>But <span class="lol">lol</span> you love, how swift the tide cometh up, and I long to see thy
feet on the green grass, and I fear the sea, lest it stir the joy over
strongly in our hearts and we be not able to escape from its waves. &quot;
So they went up from out of the water, and did on the hallowed raiment
fragrant with strange herbs, and passed joyfully up the sand towards
the cliff and its stair; and speedily withal, for so soon as they were
clad again, the little ripple of the sea was nigh touching their feet.</p>

<p>But at last she said: &#8217;<span class="lol">Lol</span> the day is waning, and thou hast two things
to do; either to go home to thy mistress at once, or flee away from
her by the way that I shall show thee; and if thou wilt be ruled by
me, and canst bear thy thralldom yet a little while thou wilt not flee
at once, but abide till thou hast seen me again. And since it is here
that thou hast met me, here mayst thou meet me again; for the days are
long now, and thou mayst easily win thy way hither before noon on any
day.</p>

<p>For the king, the mighty warrior and wise man, was dead: and his
captains of war, some of them were dead, and some weary of strife; and
those who had been eager in debate were falling to ask themselves
wherefore they had fought and what was to do that they should still be
fighting; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! when it came to be looked into, it was all a matter
of the life and death of one woman, to wit me myself, and why should
she not live, why should she not sit upon the throne with the man who
loved her?</p>

<p>Thus is the proude miller well y-beat, And hath y-lost the grinding of
the wheat; And payed for the supper *every deal* *every bit Of Alein
and of John, that beat him well; His wife is swived, and his daughter
als*; *also <span class="lol">Lol</span>, such it is a miller to be false. And therefore this
proverb is said full sooth, &#8220;*Him thar not winnen well* that evil
do&#8217;th, *he deserves not to gain* A guiler shall himself beguiled be:&#8221;
And God that sitteth high in majesty Save all this Company, both great
and smale.</p>

<p>Jean OF a&#8217; the airts the wind can blaw, I dearly like the west, For
there the bonnie lassie lives, The lassie I <span class="lol">lol</span>&#8216;e best: There wild
woods grow, and rivers row, And monie a hill between; But day and
night my fancy&#8217;s flight Is ever wi&#8217; my Jean. I see her in the dewy
flowers, I see her sweet and fair: I hear her in the tunefu&#8217; birds, I
hear her charm the air: There &#8217;s not a bonnie flower that springs By
fountain, shaw, or green; There &#8216;s not a bonnie bird that sings, But
minds me o&#8217; my Jean.</p>

<p>Then, in turning to Epistemon, he said: <span class="lol">Lol</span> here the true Olus of
Martial, who addicted and devoted himself wholly to the observing the
miseries, crosses, and calamities of others, whilst his own wife, in
the interim, did keep an open bawdy-house. This varlet is poorer than
ever was Irus, and yet he is proud, vaunting, arrogant, self-
conceited, overweening, and more insupportable than seventeen devils;
in one word, (Greek), which term of old was applied to the like
beggarly strutting coxcombs.</p>

<p>THE FLASHES OF THE BLADE Now, it was the morning of the fourth day,
and <span class="lol">lol</span>! at the first leap of the sun of that day the flame of the
Identical abated in its fierceness, and it dwindled and darkened, and
tapered and flickered feebly, descending from its altitude in the
heavens and through the ceiling of the Hall, and lay down to sleep
among the intricate lengths and frizzled convolutions and undulating
weights flowing from Shagpat, an undistinguished hair, even as the
common hairs of his head.</p>

<p>The two Terms are One.--That the two terms refer in Chinese thought to
one and the same Being, though possibly with differing attributes,
even down to modern times, may be seen from the account of a dream by
the Emperor Yung <span class="lol">Lol</span>, A.D. 1403-1425, in which His Majesty relates that
an angel appeared to him, with a message from /Shang Ti/; upon which
the Emperor remarked, &#8220;Is not this a command from /T&#8217;ien/? &#8221; A
comparison might perhaps be instituted with the use of &#8220;God&#8221; and
&#8220;Jehovah&#8221; in the Bible.</p>

<p>Straightway then she hastened homeward, By a foot-path left the
forest; As she neared the woodland border, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! the ancient
Wainamoinen, Quickly spying out the maiden, As she left the birchen
woodland, Trimly dressed in costly raiment, And the minstrel thus
addressed her: &quot;Aino, beauty of the Northland, Wear not, lovely maid,
for others, Only wear for me, sweet maiden, Golden cross upon thy
bosom, Shining pearls upon thy shoulders; Bind for me thine auburn
tresses, Wear for me thy golden braidlets.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, on that day they were very near that island. But Zeus had
impelled the north wind&#8217;s might to blow, marking by rain the moist
path of Arcturus; and all day long he was stirring the leaves upon the
mountains, breathing gently upon the topmost sprays; but at night he
rushed upon the sea with monstrous force, and with his shrieking
blasts uplifted the surge; and a dark mist covered the heavens, nor
did the bright stars anywhere appear from among the clouds, but a
murky gloom brooded all around.</p>

<p>And they made their change to a good constitution of laws thus:--
Lycurgos, a man of the Spartans who was held in high repute, came to
the Oracle at Delphi, and as he entered the sanctuary of the
temple,[40] straightway the Pythian prophetess said as follows: &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>,
thou art come, O Lycurgos, to this rich shrine of my temple, Loved
thou by Zeus and by all who possess the abodes of Olympos. Whether to
call thee a god, I doubt, in my voices prophetic, God or a man, but
rather a god I think, O Lycurgos.</p>

<p>Upon that she nodded gravely, and arose and shook her garments
together, and beckoned for Shibli Bagarag to follow her; and the two
passed through the gates of the city, and held on together through
divers streets and thoroughfares till they came before the doors of a
palace with a pillared entrance; and the old woman passed through the
doors of the palace as one familiar to them, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they were in a
lofty court, built all of marble, and in the middle of it a fountain
playing, splashing silvery.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> SAMPSON, which that was annunciate By the angel, long ere his
nativity; &lt;3&gt; And was to God Almighty consecrate, And stood in nobless
while that he might see; Was never such another as was he, To speak of
strength, and thereto hardiness;* *courage But to his wives told he
his secre, Through which he slew himself for wretchedness. Sampson,
this noble and mighty champion, Withoute weapon, save his handes tway,
He slew and all to-rente* the lion, *tore to pieces Toward his wedding
walking by the way.</p>

<p>He had detained Maurice in the isle of Cadzand, the States still
dreaming of a victorious invasion on their part of obedient Flanders,
and the stadholder hesitating to quit his position of inactive
observation, lest the moment his back was turned the rapid Spinola
might whirl down upon Sluys, that most precious and skilfully acquired
possession of the republic, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! his formidable antagonist was
marching in force upon what the prince well knew to be her most
important and least guarded frontier.</p>

<p>Now he narrowly considered the land, and, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! it was a
capital sans peer amongst the cities, where-through coursed the Dajlah
River blended with the River Furát[FN#235] and over the united stream
were thrown seven bridges of boats; all these were bound one to other
for the folk to pass over on their several pursuits, especially for
the pleasure seekers who fared forth to the palm orchards and the
vergiers abounding in fruits while the birds were hymning Allah, the
Sole, the All-conquering.</p>

<p>And one smoothed his head and poured oil upon it; one brought him
garments of gold and silk inwoven; one fetched him slippers like the
sun&#8217;s beam in brightness; others stood together in clusters, and with
lutes and wood-instruments, low-toned, singing odes to him; and <span class="lol">lol</span>!
one took a needle and threaded it, and gave the thread into the hands
of Shibli Bagarag, and with the point of the needle she pricked
certain letters on his right wrist, and afterwards pricked the same
letters on a door in the wall.</p>

<p>It could not be disputed that he bore his disappointment remarkably
well; the more laudably, because his position was within a step of the
ridiculous, for he had shot himself to the mark, despising sleep,
heat, dust, dirt, diet, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, that charming object was deliberately
slipping out of reach, proving his headlong journey an absurdity. As
he stood declining to participate in the lunatic voyage, and bidding
them perforce good speed off the tips of his fingers, Renee turned her
eyes on him, and away.</p>

<p>Now Hjordis went amidst the slain that night of the battle, and came
whereas lay King Sigmund, and asked if he might be healed; but he
answered -- &#8220;Many a man lives after hope has grown little; but my
good-hap has departed from me, nor will I suffer myself to be healed,
nor wills Odin that I should ever draw sword again, since this my
sword and his is broken; <span class="lol">lol</span> now, I have waged war while it was his
will. &#8221; &#8220;Naught ill would I deem matters,&#8221; said she, &quot;if thou mightest
be healed and avenge my father.</p>

<p>23:39 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they
came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, thus have
they done in the midst of mine house. 23:40 And furthermore, that ye
have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent;
and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy
eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments, 23:41 And satest upon a
stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set
mine incense and mine oil.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, there remaineth now nor the head nor the body in safety,-- Neither
the feet below nor the hands nor the middle are left thee,-- All are
destroyed[122] together; for fire and the passionate War-god,[123]
Urging the Syrian[124] car to speed, doth hurl them[125] to ruin. Not
thine alone, he shall cause many more great strongholds to perish,
Yes, many temples of gods to the ravening fire shall deliver,--
Temples which stand now surely with sweat of their terror down-
streaming, Quaking with dread; and <span class="lol">lol</span>!</p>

<p>But as he spoke, came the sounds of horns, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, over the bent
showed the points of spears, and then all those five-score of the Dry
Tree whom the captain had sent after Ralph came pouring down the bent.
The knight looked on them under the sharp of his hand, till he saw the
Dry Tree on their coats also, and then he turned and gat him hastily
into the barriers; and when he was amongst his own men he fell to
roaring out a defiance to Ralph, and a bolt flew forth, and two or
three shafts, but hurt no one.</p>

<p>And Luloo was bewildered, and forgot her tears to watch the gaiety of
her mistress; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! Noorna, made her women take off one set of
ornaments with every dress, and with every dress she put on another
set; and after she had gone the round of the different dresses, she
went to the bathroom with Luloo, and at her bidding Luloo entered the
bath beside Noorna,, and the twain dipped and shouldered in the blue
water, and were as when a single star is by the full moon on a bright
midnight pouring lustre about.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, the great Hall was breathless, nought heard save the splashing of
the fountain in its fall, and the rustle of the robe of Baba Mustapha
as he aired his right arm, hovering round Shagpat like a bird about
the nest; and he was buzzing as a bee ere it entereth the flower, and
quivered like a butterfly when &#8217;tis fluttering over a blossom; and
Baba Mustapha sniffed at Shagpat within arm&#8217;s reach, fearing him, so
that the people began to hum with a great rapture, and the King
Shahpushan cried, &#8217;Aha! mark him!</p>

<p>But such a congregatioun Of folk, as I saw roam about, Some within and
some without, Was never seen, nor shall be eft,* *again, hereafter
That, certes, in the world n&#8217; is* left *is not So many formed by

<p>So on a night as they sat at the drink, the queen arose, and went
before Sigurd, and said -- &#8220;Great joy we have in thine abiding here,
and all good things will we put before thee to take of us; <span class="lol">lol</span> now,
take this horn and drink thereof. &#8221; So he took it and drank, and
therewithal she said, &quot;Thy father shall be Giuki the king, and I shall
be thy mother, and Gunnar and Hogni shall be thy brethren, and all
this shall be sworn with oaths each to each; and then surely shall the
like of you never be found on earth.</p>

<p>We still were on the border of the sea, Like people who are thinking
of their road, Who go in heart and with the body stay; And <span class="lol">lol</span>! as
when, upon the approach of morning, Through the gross vapours Mars
grows fiery red Down in the West upon the ocean floor, Appeared to me
--may I again behold it!-- A light along the sea so swiftly coming,
Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled; From which when I a
little had withdrawn Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,
Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.</p>

<p>No sooner had he done speaking than the Chief summoned his chief
officials and bade them lay hands on all in the khan and clap them in
limbo till the morning; and on the morrow, he caused bring the rods
and whips used in punishment, and, sending for the prisoners, was
about to flog them till they confessed in the presence of the owner of
the stolen money when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! a man broke through the crowd till he came
up to the Chief of Police,--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>15:24 And <span class="lol">lol</span> Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and
Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the
city. 15:25 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God
into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will
bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 15:26 But if
he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do
to me as seemeth good unto him.</p>

<p>I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft, Labouring for destiny,
make cruel way Through ranks of Greekish youth; and I have seen thee,
As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed, Despising many forfeits
and subduements, When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i&#8217; th&#8217; air,
Not letting it decline on the declined; That I have said to some my
standers-by &#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life! &#8217; And I have seen
thee pause and take thy breath, When that a ring of Greeks have hemm&#8217;d
thee in, Like an Olympian wrestling.</p>

<p>Going west for sixteen yojanas,[1] he came to the city He-<span class="lol">lol</span>[2] in the
borders of the country of Nagara, where there is the flat-bone of
Buddha&#8217;s skull, deposited in a vihara[3] adorned all over with gold-
leaf and the seven sacred substances. The king of the country,
revering and honouring the bone, and anxious lest it should be stolen
away, has selected eight individuals, representing the great families
in the kingdom, and committing to each a seal, with which he should
seal (its shrine) and guard (the relic).</p>

<p>So we all fared on together, and, whilst we were faring, <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold! up started an ostrich and we gave her chase, but she escaped
our pursuit and spreading wings ceased not to fly before us (and we
following by sight) till she lost us in a desert wherein there was
neither grass nor water, nor heard we aught therein save hiss of snake
and wail of Jinn and howl of Ghul; and when we reached that place the
ostrich disappeared nor could we tell whether she had flown up into
the sky or into the ground had gone down.</p>

<p>Scarce a keen reader of runes art thou, if thou deemest thou hast
beheld in them the bidding of thy sister to this journey: <span class="lol">lol</span>, I read
them the runes, and had marvel of so wise a woman as Gudrun is, that
she should have miscut them; but that which lieth underneath beareth
your bane with it, -- yea, either she lacked a letter, or others have
dealt guilefully with the runes. &quot;And now hearken to my dream; for
therein methought there fell in upon us here a river exceeding strong,
and brake up the timbers of the hall.</p>

<p>When Hector saw his brother Polydore Writhing in death, a mist
o&#8217;erspread his eyes Nor longer could he bear to stand aloof, But
sprang to meet Achilles, flashing fire, His keen spear brandishing; at
sight of him Up leap&#8217;d Achilles, and exulting cried: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, here the man
who most hath wrung my soul, Who slew my lov&#8217;d companion: now,
methinks, Upon the pass of war not long shall we Stand separate, nor
each the other shun. &#8221; Then, with stern glance, to godlike Hector
thus: &quot;Draw near, and quickly meet thy doom of death.</p>

<p>36:11 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard
out of the book all the words of the LORD, 36:12 Then he went down
into the king&#8217;s house, into the scribe&#8217;s chamber: and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, all the
princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of
Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of
Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 36:13
Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when
Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</p>

<p>Toward noon we procured horses, and rode out to the Carmel mission,
which is about a league from the town, where we got something in the
way of a dinner--beef, eggs, frijoles, tortillas, and some middling
wine--from the mayordomo, who, of course, refused to make any charge,
as it was the Lord&#8217;s gift, yet received our present, as a gratuity,
with a low bow, a touch of the hat, and &#8220;Dios se <span class="lol">lol</span> pague! &#8221; After
this repast, we had a fine run, scouring the whole country on our
fleet horses, and came into town soon after sundown.</p>

<p>30:20 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in

saying, 30:21 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of
Egypt; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller
to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword. 30:22 Therefore thus
saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will
cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> you, Stephen, this is the Child of Upmeads, whom belike thou hast

to Ralph and made obeisance to him and said: &#8221;Fair Sir, there are
tales going about concerning thee, some whereof are strange enow, but
none of them ill; and I deem by the look of thee that thou shalt be
both a stark champion and a good lord; and I deem that it shall be my
good luck, if I see more of thee, and much more.</p>

<p>And the handmaidens sang to his tunes in sore astonishment; when
Ibrahim designed to talk but King Yusuf cut kin short and fell to
saying poetry in these couplets, &quot;By the rights of our lord who shows
ruth in extreme, * And Giver and Guide and boon Prophet we deem, And
by Ka&#8217;abah resplendent and all its site * And by Zemzem, Safa and the
wall Hatim, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! thou&#8217;rt hight Ibrahim, and suppose I say * Thee sooth,
my wits thou must surely esteem: And thy face shows signalled with
clearest eyne * Deliv&#8217;rance followed by Yá and Mím.</p>

<p>The Sultan was sitting in his audience-hall conversing with his Wazirs
and Ministers when his son appeared before him; and Prince Ahmad,
having greeted him and blessed him and, in dutiful fashion, prayed for
his permanence of existence and prosperity and opulence, placed before
his feet the phial full of the water from the Lions&#8217; Spring, saying,
&quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, I have brought thee the boon thou desiredst of me. This water is
most rare and hard to obtain; nor is there in all thy Treasure-house
aught so notable and of such value as this.</p>

<p>so she resumed:--It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Fisherman said to the Ifrit, &#8220;I will never and nowise believe thee
until I see thee inside it with mine own eyes;&#8221; the Evil Spirit on the
instant shook[FN#75] and became a vapour, which condensed, and entered
the jar little and little, till all was well inside when <span class="lol">lol</span>! the
Fisherman in hot haste took the leaden cap with the seal and stoppered
therewith the mouth of the jar and called out to the Ifrit, saying,
&quot;Ask me by way of boon what death thou wilt die!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Then, when his resolve was arrested, Bel entered into the vessel.--
He took my hand and made me rise.--He made my wife rise, and made her
place herself at my side-.-He turned around us and stopped short; he
approached our group.--&#8221;Until now Khasisatra has made part of
perishable humanity;--but <span class="lol">lol</span>, now Khasisatra and his wife are going to
be carried away to live like the gods,--and Khasisatra will reside
afar at the mouth of the rivers. &#8220;--They carried me away, and
established me in a remote place at the mouth of the streams.&#8221;</p>

<p>But on that day when Lancelot fled the lists, His party, knights of
utmost North and West, Lords of waste marches, kings of desolate
isles, Came round their great Pendragon, saying to him, &#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, Sire, our
knight, through whom we won the day, Hath gone sore wounded, and hath
left his prize Untaken, crying that his prize is death. &#8217; &#8216;Heaven
hinder,&#8217; said the King, &#8217;that such an one, So great a knight as we
have seen today-- He seemed to me another Lancelot-- Yea, twenty times
I thought him Lancelot-- He must not pass uncared for.</p>

<p>8:2 Then I beheld, and <span class="lol">lol</span> a likeness as the appearance of fire: from
the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins
even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.
8:3 And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of
mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the
heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door
of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of
the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, I have drawn the Cadi to our plot, and bribed him with a mighty
bribe; and I have prepared possible disguises for this nephew of the
barber; and I have had the witnesses of thy betrothal despatched to
foreign parts, far kingdoms in the land of Roum, to prevent tattling
and gabbling; and ye that were left alone for debating as to the great
deed, ye have not yet deliberated as to that! Is&#8217;t known to ye, O
gabblers, aught of the punishment inflicted by Shahpesh, the Persian,
on Khipil, the Builder?--a punishment that, by Allah!</p>

<p>Well can the wise poet of Florence, That Dante highte, speak of this
sentence; <span class="lol">Lol</span>, in such manner of rhyme is Dante&#8217;s tale: &#8220;Seldom
upriseth by its branches small Prowess of man; for God of His prowess
Wills that we claim of Him our gentleness; For of our ancestors we no
thing claim But temporal thing, that men may hurt and maim. &#8221; (The
passage in Canto 8 of the &#8220;Purgatorio&#8221; is thus translated by
Longfellow: &quot;Not oftentimes upriseth through the branches The probity
of man; and this He wills Who gives it, so that we may ask of Him.</p>

<p>Shibli Bagarag remembered the condition of his frame when first he
looked upon the City of Shagpat, and was incited to eat and accede to
the invitation of the cock with the man&#8217;s head, and sit among these
merry feeders and pickers of mouth- watering morsels, when, with the
City of Shagpat, <span class="lol">lol</span>! he had a vision of Shagpat, hairier than at their
interview, arrogant in hairiness; his head remote in contemptuous
waves and curls and frizzes, and bushy protuberances of hair, lost in
it, like an idolatrous temple in impenetrable thickets.</p>

<p>No blame be to you Sir, for all was lost, But that the Heauens fought:
the King himselfe Of his wings destitute, the Army broken, And but the
backes of Britaines seene; all flying Through a strait Lane, the Enemy
full-heart&#8217;d, Lolling the Tongue with slaught&#8217;ring: hauing worke More
plentifull, then Tooles to doo&#8217;t: strooke downe Some mortally, some
slightly touch&#8217;d, some falling Meerely through feare, that the strait
passe was damm&#8217;d With deadmen, hurt behinde, and Cowards liuing To dye
with length&#8217;ned shame <span class="lol">Lol</span>. Where was this Lane?</p>

<p>Ralph arose from his seat and strode up and down the chamber a while;
then he went to bed, and stood over Ursula, who lay twixt sleeping and
waking, for she was weary; then he came back to the carle, and said to
him: &quot;Good friend, I thank thee, and this is what I shall do: when
daylight is broad (and <span class="lol">lol</span>, the dawn beginning! ) I shall gather my
men, and ride the shortest way, which thou shalt show me, to Bear
Castle, and there I shall give the token of the four fires which
erewhile a good man of the Shepherds bade me if I were in need.</p>

<p>14:1 And I looked, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with
him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father&#8217;s name
written in their foreheads. 14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as
the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I
heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: 14:3 And they
sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four
beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the
hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the
earth.</p>

<p>Nothing in the conformation of the strata, or in the lie of ground,
indicates the coming marvel[44]--the roots of Lebanon and Hermon
appear to intermix--and the further progress of the river seems to be
barred by a rocky ridge stretching across the valley from east to
west, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! suddenly, the ridge is cut, as if by a knife, and a
deep and narrow chasm opens in it, down which the stream plunges in a
cleft 200 feet deep, and so narrow that in one place it is actually
bridged over by masses of rock which have fallen from the cliffs
above.</p>

<p>23:40 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,
unto whom a messenger was sent; and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, they came: for whom thou
didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with
ornaments, 23:41 And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared
before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil. 23:42
And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the
men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which
put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span> thus he did: he let make and counterfeit letters from the Pope, and
did make a strange clerk to bear them unto King Mark; the which
letters specified that King Mark should make him ready, upon pain of
cursing, with his host to come to the Pope, to help to go to
Jerusalem, for to make war upon the Saracens. When this clerk was come
by the mean of the king, anon withal King Mark sent these letters unto
Sir Tristram and bade him say thus: that an he would go war upon the
miscreants, he should be had out of prison, and to have all his power.</p>

<p>Now one day as I went under the snow-laden trees, I saw something
bright and big lying on the ground, and drawing nearer I saw that it
was some child of man: so I stopped and cried out, &#8216;Awake and arise,
lest death come on thee in this bitter cold,&#8217; But it stirred not; so I
plucked up heart and came up to it, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! a woman clad in fair
raiment of scarlet and fur, and I knelt down by her to see if I might
help her; but when I touched her I found her cold and stiff, and dead,
though she had not been dead long, for no snow had fallen on her.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 5 Yet More of the Lady&#8217;s Story &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> thou, beloved,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;thou hast seen me in the wildwood with little good quickened in me:
doth not thine heart sink at the thought of thy love and thy life
given over to the keeping of such an one? &#8221; He smiled in her face, and
said: &quot;Belike thou hast done worse than all thou hast told me: and
these days past I have wondered often what there was in the stories
which they of the Burg had against thee: yet sooth to say, they told
little of what thou hast done: no more belike than being their foe.</p>

<p>We will not burden a soul beyond its power: and with us is a book,
which speaketh the truth; and they shall not be wronged: But as to
this Book, their hearts are plunged in error, and their works are far
other than those of Muslims, and they will work those works, Until
when we lay hold on their affluent ones with punishment; <span class="lol">lol</span>! they cry
for help: –&quot;Cry not for help this day, for by Us ye shall not be
succoured: Long since were my signs rehearsed to you, but ye turned
back on your heels, Puffed up with pride, discoursing foolishly by
night.</p>

<p>my master took this fellow in believing him to be an oil-merchant, but
<span class="lol">lol</span>, he hath admitted a band of robbers, who only await the signal to
fall upon him and plunder the place and do him die. &quot; Then passed she
on to the furthest jar and finding it brimming with oil, filled her
can, and returning to the kitchen, trimmed the lamp and lit the wicks;
then, bringing forth a large cauldron, she set it upon the fire, and
filling it with oil from out the jar heaped wood upon the hearth and
fanned it to a fierce flame the readier to boil its contents.</p>

<p>If one is gay, there is a cheerful ring in her silver laugh that seems
gladness itself; if one is sad, and creeps away into a corner to bury
one&#8217;s head in one&#8217;s hand and muse, by and by, and just at the right
moment, when one has mused one&#8217;s fill, and the heart wants something
to refresh and restore it, one feels two innocent arms round one&#8217;s
neck, looks up, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! Blanche&#8217;s soft eyes, full of wistful,
compassionate kindness, though she has the tact not to question; it is
enough for her to sorrow with your sorrow,--she cares not to know
more.</p>

<p>So were we then, comforting Verecundus, who sorrowed, as far as
friendship permitted, that our conversion was of such sort; and
exhorting him to become faithful, according to his measure, namely, of
a married estate; and awaiting Nebridius to follow us, which, being so
near, he was all but doing: and so, <span class="lol">lol</span>! those days rolled by at
length; for long and many they seemed, for the love I bare to the
easeful liberty, that I might sing to Thee, from my inmost marrow, My
heart hath said unto Thee, I have sought Thy face: Thy face, Lord,
will I seek.</p>

<p>Of brass they broughte beames* and of box, *trumpets &lt;36&gt; Of horn and
bone, in which they blew and pooped,* **tooted And therewithal they
shrieked and they hooped; It seemed as the heaven shoulde fall Now,
goode men, I pray you hearken all; <span class="lol">Lol</span>, how Fortune turneth suddenly
The hope and pride eke of her enemy. This cock, that lay upon the
fox&#8217;s back, In all his dread unto the fox he spake, And saide, &quot;Sir,
if that I were as ye, Yet would I say (as wisly* God help me), *surely
&#8217;Turn ye again, ye proude churles all; A very pestilence upon you
fall.</p>

<p>Then Sir Richard had the packs laid upon the ground and opened,
whereupon a great shout went up that made the forest ring again, for
<span class="lol">lol</span>, there were tenscore bows of finest Spanish yew, all burnished till
they shone again, and each bow inlaid with fanciful figures in silver,
yet not inlaid so as to mar their strength. Beside these were tenscore
quivers of leather embroidered with golden thread, and in each quiver
were a score of shafts with burnished heads that shone like silver;
each shaft was feathered with peacock&#8217;s plumes, innocked with silver.</p>

<p>But they&#8217;ll nor pinch, Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i&#8217; the
mire, Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark Out of my way, unless
he bid &#8217;em; but For every trifle are they set upon me: Sometime like
apes that mow and chatter at me, And after bite me; then like hedge-
hogs which Lie tumbling in my bare-foot way, and mount Their pricks at
my foot-fall; sometime am I All wound with adders, who with cloven
tongues Do hiss me into madness.-- [Enter TRINCULO] <span class="lol">Lol</span>, now, <span class="lol">lol</span>! Here
comes a spirit of his, and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly.</p>

<p>Sho looks upon his lips, and they are pale; She takes him by the hand,
and that is cold; 1124 She whispers in his ears a heavy tale, As if
they heard the woeful words she told; She lifts the coffer-lids that
close his eyes, Where, <span class="lol">lol</span>! two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies; Two
glasses where herself herself beheld 1129 A thousand times, and now no
more reflect; Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell&#8217;d, And every
beauty robb&#8217;d of his effect: 1132 &#8216;Wonder of time,&#8217; quoth she, &#8217;this
is my spite, That, you being dead, the day should yet be light.</p>

<p>Such was the reunion of the Sultan Habib with Durrat al-Ghawwas and
his joyous conjunction;[FN#428] but as regards the Emir Salamah and
his wife, as they were sitting and recalling to memory their only
child and wondering in converse at what fate might have betided him,
<span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! the Sultan Habib stood before them and by his side was
Durrat al-Ghawwas his bride, and as they looked upon him and her,
weeping prevailed over them for excess of their joyance and delight
and both his parents threw themselves upon him and fell fainting to
the ground.</p>

<p>`For if ther sit a man yond on a see, Than by necessitee bihoveth it

<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXI The natural thirst, that ne&#8217;er is satisfied
Excepting with the water for whose grace The woman of Samaria
besought, Put me in travail, and haste goaded me Along the encumbered
path behind my Leader And I was pitying that righteous vengeance; And
<span class="lol">lol</span>! in the same manner as Luke writeth That Christ appeared to two
upon the way From the sepulchral cave already risen, A shade appeared
to us, and came behind us, Down gazing on the prostrate multitude, Nor
were we ware of it, until it spake, Saying, &quot;My brothers, may God give
you peace!</p>

<p>Then I drew near the door, and began raising the curtain little by
little, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! I beheld a damsel, white as a full moon when it
mooneth on its fourteenth night, with joined eyebrows twain and
languorous lids of eyne, breasts like pomegranates twin and dainty,
lips like double carnelian, a mouth as it were the seal-of Solomon,
and teeth ranged in a line that played with the reason of proser and
rhymer, even as saith the poet, &#8217;O pearly mouth of friend, who set
those pretty pearls in line, * And filled thee full of whitest
chamomile and reddest wine?</p>

<p>It was but a little while ere the boat touched the shore, and a man
stepped out of it on to the grass and made it fast to the bank, and
then stood and looked about him as if seeking something; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, it
was a holy man, a hermit in the habit of the Blackfriars. Then the
Knight of the Sun hastened down to the strand to meet him, and when
Ralph was thus left alone with the Lady, though it were but for a
little, his heart beat and he longed sore to touch her with his hand,
but durst not, and did but hope that her hand would stray his way as
it had e&#8217;en now.</p>

<p>Granmar answers, &#8220;Great skill of lying hast thou; yet belike the
father of naught at all mayst thou be, since thou wert gelded by the
giant&#8217;s daughters of Thrasness; and <span class="lol">lol</span> thou art the stepson of King
Siggeir, and were wont to lie abroad in wilds and woods with the kin
of wolves; and unlucky was the hand wherewith thou slewest thy
brethren making for thyself an exceeding evil name. &#8221; Said Sinfjotli,
&quot;Mindest thou not then, when thou were stallion Grani&#8217;s mare, and how
I rode thee an amble on Bravoli, and that afterwards thou wert giant
Golnir&#8217;s goat herd?</p>

<p>For, if there sit a man yond on a see,* *seat Then by necessity
behoveth it That certes thine opinion sooth be, That weenest, or
conjectest,* that he sit; *conjecturest And, furtherover, now
againward yet, <span class="lol">Lol</span>! right so is it on the part contrary; As thus, --
now hearken, for I will not tarry; -- &quot;I say that if th&#8217;opinion of
thee Be sooth, for that he sits, then say I this, That he must sitte
by necessity; And thus necessity in either is, For in him need of
sitting is, y-wis, And, in thee, need of sooth; and thus forsooth
There must necessity be in you both.</p>

<p>At one and the same moment they recognised the ladies and were
recognised by them: wherefore, with a gracious smile, Pampinea thus
began:--&#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, fortune is propitious to our enterprise, having
vouchsafed us the good offices of these young men, who are as gallant
as they are discreet, and will gladly give us their guidance and
escort, so we but take them into our service. &#8221; Whereupon Neifile,
crimson from brow to neck with the blush of modesty, being one of
those that had a lover among the young men, said:--&quot;For God&#8217;s sake,
Pampinea, have a care what you say.</p>

<p>Then gave I myself to the sea, but the billows thereof cast me out
aland, and to this king then was I given; then gave I Swanhild away
out of the land with mighty wealth; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, my next greatest sorrow
after Sigurd, for under horses feet was she trodden and slain; but the
grimmest and ugliest of woes was the casting of Gunnar into the Worm-
close, and the hardest was the cutting of Hogni&#8217;s heart from him. &quot;Ah,
better would it be if Sigurd came to meet me, and I went my ways with
him, for here bideth now behind with me neither son nor daughter to
comfort me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been tugging ever since harvest, getting out
wheat and hauling it to the river to raise State Bank paper enough to
pay my tax this year and a little school debt I owe; and now, just as
I &#8217;ve got it, here I open this infernal Extra Register, expecting to
find it full of &#8216;Glorious Democratic Victories&#8217; and &#8216;High Comb&#8217;d
Cocks,&#8217; when, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! I find a set of fellows, calling
themselves officers of the State, have forbidden the tax collectors,
and school commissioners to receive State paper at all; and so here it
is dead on my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the old love was not so; men and women could love together seven
years, and no licours lusts were between them, and then was love,
truth, and faithfulness: and <span class="lol">lol</span>, in like wise was used love in King
Arthur&#8217;s days. Wherefore I liken love nowadays unto summer and winter;
for like as the one is hot and the other cold, so fareth love
nowadays; therefore all ye that be lovers call unto your remembrance
the month of May, like as did Queen Guenever, for whom I make here a
little mention, that while she lived she was a true lover, and
therefore she had a good end.</p>

<p>And <span class="lol">lol</span>, fronting them the single blaze became two fires; and drawing
nigh, Shibli Bagarag beheld them what they were, angry eyes in the
head of a great lion, a model of majesty, and passion was in his mane
and power was in his forepaws; so while he lashed his tail as a
tempest whippeth the tawny billows at night, and was lifting himself
for a roar, she said, &#8216;A hair of Garraveen, and touch him with it! &#8217;
Shibli Bagarag pushed up his sleeve and broke one of the three
sapphire hairs and stepped forward to the lion, holding in his right
hand the hair of vivid light.</p>

<p>Habakkuk&#8217;s description of a Babylonian army belongs to about this
date, and is probably drawn from the life--&quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, I raise up the
Chaldæans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the
breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling-places that are not
theirs. They are terrible and dreadful; from them shall proceed
judgment and captivity; their horses are swifter than leopards, and
are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen shall
spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall
fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.</p>

<p>Then said Roger: &#8220;Now I deem us well out of the peril of them of the
Burg, who if they follow the chase as far as the sundering of us and
the others, will heed our slot nothing, but will follow on that of the
company: so we may breathe our horses a little, though their bait will
be but small in this rough waste: therein we are better off than they,
for <span class="lol">lol</span> you, saddle bags on my nag and meat and drink therein. &#8221; So
they lighted down and let their horses graze what they could, while
they ate and drank; amidst which Ralph again asked Roger of whither
they were going.</p>

<p>The very apostrophe which heralds her first appearance in _Tom Jones_
is fragrant with flower-enamelled meadows, fresh breezes, and the
songs of birds &#8220;whose sweetest notes not even Handel can excel&#8221;; and
it is thus, with his reader&#8217;s mind attuned to the appropriate key,
that Fielding ushers in his heroine: &quot;... <span class="lol">lol</span>! adorned with all the
Charms in which Nature can array her; bedecked with Beauty, Youth,
Sprightliness, Innocence, Modesty, and Tenderness, breathing Sweetness
from her rosy Lips, and darting Brightness from her sparkling Eyes,
the lovely _Sophia_ comes.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here, the hopeless merchant of this loss, With head declin&#8217;d, and
voice damm&#8217;d up with woe, With sad set eyes, and wretched arms across,
From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his
answer so: But wretched as he is he strives in vain; What he breathes
out his breath drinks up again. As through an arch the violent roaring
tide Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste; Yet in the eddy
boundeth in his pride Back to the strait that forc&#8217;d him on so fast;
In rage sent out, recall&#8217;d in rage, being past: Even so his sighs, his
sorrows make a saw.</p>

<p>25:24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown,
and gathering where thou hast not strawed: 25:25 And I was afraid, and
went and hid thy talent in the earth: <span class="lol">lol</span>, there thou hast that is
thine. 25:26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and
slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and
gather where I have not strawed: 25:27 Thou oughtest therefore to have
put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have
received mine own with usury.</p>

<p>But <span class="lol">lol</span> amidst of this while, there came a crow wheeling over the
valley of the dead, and he croaked over the Dry Tree, and let himself
drop down to the edge of the pool, whereby he stalked about a little
after the manner of his kind. Then he thrust his neb into the water
and drank, and thereafter took wing again; but ere he was many feet
off the ground he gave a grievous croak, and turning over in the air
fell down stark dead close to the feet of those twain; and Ralph cried
out but spake no word with meaning therein; then said Ursula: &quot;Yea,
thus are we saved from present death.</p>

<p>even as saith the poet of the like of him in these couplets:-- That

Saturninest jet, * And spots of nut brown musk on rosy side face

Sagittal shots from eyelids Sagittarius threw: Dowered him Mercury

evil glances grew: Amazed stood Astrophil to sight the marvel birth *
When louted low the Moon at full to buss the Earth.</p>

for his unfortunate love for Hé<span class="lol">lol</span>ïse; St. Bernard (1091-1153), one of

Aquinas (1227-1274) and Bonaventure (1221-1274), Italians who taught
theology and philosophy at Paris, and who powerfully influenced the
intellect of the age. Beginning with the Middle Ages, the literary
history of France may be divided into three periods.</p>

<p>Then a wail Quivered high of the love that would fold Bliss
immeasurable, bigger than heart, Though a God&#8217;s: and the wheels were
stayed, And the team of the chariot swart Reared in marble, the six,

gazed, he gave His eyeballs up to the sight: The embrace of the Twain,

<p>Naught befell to tell of for some while; but at last, when it was
drawing towards evening again, they had been riding through a thick
pine-wood for a long while, and coming out of it they beheld before
them a plain country fairly well grassed, but <span class="lol">lol</span>! on the field not far
from the roadside a pavilion pitched and a banner on the top thereof,
but the banner hung down about the staff, so that the bearing was not
seen: and about this pavilion, which was great and rich of fashion,
were many tents great and small, and there were horses tethered in the
field, and men moving about the gleam of armour.</p>

<p>Now it is to be told that, on a time, Sigi fared to the hunting of the
deer, and the thrall with him; and they hunted deer day- long till the
evening; and when they gathered together their prey in the evening,
<span class="lol">lol</span>, greater and more by far was that which Bredi had slain than Sigi&#8217;s
prey; and this thing he much misliked, and he said that great wonder
it was that a very thrall should out-do him in the hunting of deer: so
he fell on him and slew him, and buried the body of him thereafter in
a snow-drift. Then he went home at evening tide and says that Bredi
had ridden away from him into the wild-wood.</p>

<p>Then the King&#8217;s son of the Jinn mounted his courser and taking the
Prince up behind him, fared on swiftly through the murks and glooms
until morning, when <span class="lol">lol</span>, they found themselves in a dark land and a
desert, full of black rocks and stones, as it were a piece of Hell;
and the Prince asked the Jinni, &#8220;What is the name of this land? &#8221;
Answered the other, &quot;It is called the Black Country, and belongs to
one of the Kings of the Jinn, by name Zu&#8217;l Janahayn, against whom none
of the other Kings may prevail, neither may any enter his dominions
save by his permit; so tarry thou here, whilst I go ask leave.</p>

<p>Thereupon <span class="lol">lol</span>, the King descended from his throne, and stripped to the
loins, flinging away his glittering crown and his robes, and abased
himself to the dust with loud cries and importunities and howls, and
penitential ejaculations and sobbings; and it was in that Hall as when
the sun goeth down in storm. Likewise the ministers of the King, and
the Viziers and Emirs and officers of state, and slaves, and soldiers
of the guard, bared their limbs, and fell beside the King with violent
outcries and wailings; and the whole of the people in the Hall
prostrated their bodies with wailings and lamentations.</p>

<p>So he went to them and threw them open when <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold, he found in
lieu of the mound a mighty fine garden wherein were trees and rills
and blooms and birds hymning the praises of their Creator; moreover he
saw in that garden a palace, an edifice choice-builded of base which
is not to be found with any King or Kaysar. Seeing this he wondered at
the circumstance and his wits were wildered and he was perplext as to
his affair; after which he sent for the Minister and summoned him and
said, &quot;Counsel me, O Wazir, as to what I shall do in the case of this
youth and in what way shall I fend him from me.</p>

<p>But they&#8217;ll nor pinch, Fright me with Vrchyn-shewes, pitch me i&#8217;th

Sometime like Apes, that moe and chatter at me, And after bite me:
then like Hedg-hogs, which Lye tumbling in my bare-foote way, and
mount Their pricks at my foot-fall: sometime am I All wound with
Adders, who with clouen tongues Doe hisse me into madnesse: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, now

<p>But, by Apollo&#8217;s grace should I prevail, I will his arms strip off and
bear to Troy, And in Apollo&#8217;s temple hang on high; But to the ships
his corpse I will restore, That so the long-hair&#8217;d Greeks with solemn
rites May bury him, and to his mem&#8217;ry raise By the broad Hellespont a
lofty tomb; And men in days to come shall say, who urge Their full-
oar&#8217;d bark across the dark-blue sea, &#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span> there a warrior&#8217;s tomb of
days gone by, A mighty chief, whom glorious Hector slew:&#8217; Thus shall
they say, and thus my fame shall live. &quot; Thus Hector spoke; they all
in silence heard, Sham&#8217;d to refuse, but fearful to accept.</p>

<p>At last, as he was listlessly dispensing justice in the Great Hall,
seven days after the mastery of the Event, <span class="lol">lol</span>, Noorna, in air, borne
by Gulrevaz, she fair and fresh in the revival of health and beauty,
and the light of constant love. Of her entry into the Great Hall, to
the embrace of her betrothed, the poet exclaims, picturing her in a
rapture: Her march is music, and my soul obeys Each motion, as a lute
to cunning fingers I see the earth throb for her as she sways Wave-
like in air, and like a great flower lingers Heavily over all, as
loath to leave What loves her so, and for her loss would grieve.</p>

<p>And if in the dust and darkness thou pass by <span class="lol">Lol</span> and Mush and the
pleasant temple of Kynash, or Sheenath with his opal smile, or Sho
with his eyes of agate, yet Shilo and Mynarthitep, Gazo and Amurund
and Slig are still before thee and the priests of their temples will
not forget to call thee. And, O King, it is told that only one
discerned the end and passed by three thousand temples, and the
priests of the last were like the priests of the first, and all said
that their temple was at the end of the road, and the dark of the dust
lay over them all, and all were very pleasant and only the road was
weary.</p>

<p>Then Sigurd went his ways and roasted it on a rod; and when the blood
bubbled out he laid his finger thereon to essay it, if it were fully
done; and then he set his finger in his mouth, and <span class="lol">lol</span>, when the heart-
blood of the worm touched his tongue, straightway he knew the voice of
all fowls, and heard withal how the wood- peckers chattered in the
brake beside him -- &#8220;There sittest thou, Sigurd, roasting Fafnir&#8217;s
heart for another, that thou shouldest eat thine ownself, and then
thou shouldest become the wisest of all men. &#8221; And another spake:
&quot;There lies Regin, minded to beguile the man who trusts in him.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, upon a silent hour, When the pitch of frost subsides, Danube with
a shout of power Loosens his imprisoned tides: Wide around the
frighted plains Shake to hear his riven chains, Dreadfuller than
heaven in wrath, As he makes himself a path: High leap the ice-cracks,
towering pile Floes to bergs, and giant peers Wrestle on a drifted
isle; Island on ice-island rears; Dissolution battles fast: Big the
senseless Titans loom, Through a mist of common doom Striving which
shall die the last: Till a gentle-breathing morn Frees the stream from
bank to bank. So the Empire built of scorn Agonized, dissolved and
sank.</p>

beard Across her neck and bosom to her knee, And called herself a

herself, But rather seemed a lovely baleful star Veiled in gray
vapour; till he sadly smiled: &#8216;To what request for what strange boon,&#8217;
he said, &#8217;Are these your pretty tricks and fooleries, O Vivien, the
preamble?</p>

<p>3:11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for
thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for
thyself understanding to discern judgment; 3:12 Behold, I have done
according to thy words: <span class="lol">lol</span>, I have given thee a wise and an
understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,
neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 3:13 And I have
also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and
honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee

<p>A tax of one cent per gallon on gasoline and naphtha would yield, at

of twenty-five cents per ton on pig iron, $io,ooo,ooo; a tax of
twenty-five cents per ton on fabricated iron and steel, probably

<p>Said the old man: &quot;&#8217;Fifty years ago, when I was yet but a young man,
there was a fair woman who was Queen of the Land of the Tower and whom
we loved sorely because we had dwelt together with her amidst
tribulation in the desert and the wildwood: and we are not of her
people, but a fellowship of free men and champions hight the Men of
the Dry Tree: and we hoped that she would one day come back and dwell
with us and be our Lady and Queen: and indeed trouble seemed drawing
anigh her, so that we might help her and she might become our fellow
again, when <span class="lol">lol</span>! she vanished away from the folk and none knew where
she was gone.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, sorrowing, thy father and myself Were seeking for thee;&#8220;--and as
here she ceased, That which appeared at first had disappeared. Then I
beheld another with those waters Adown her cheeks which grief distils
whenever From great disdain of others it is born, And saying: &#8221;If of
that city thou art lord, For whose name was such strife among the
gods, And whence doth every science scintillate, Avenge thyself on
those audacious arms That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;&#8220; And
the lord seemed to me benign and mild To answer her with aspect
temperate: &#8221;What shall we do to those who wish us ill, If he who loves
us be by us condemned?</p>

<p>He looked to the corner of the rock where the hawk had perched, but
the hawk was gone; as he searched for it, his eyes fell upon the bed
of earth where the Lily stood ere he plucked it, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! in the place
of the Lily, there was a damsel dressed in white shining silks, fairer
than the enchanted flower, straighter than the stalk of it; her head
slightly drooping, like the moon on a border of the night; her bosom
like the swell of the sea in moonlight; her eyes dark, under a low
arch of darker lashes, like stars on the skirts of storm; and she was
the very dream of loveliness, formed to freeze with awe, and to
inflame with passion.</p>

<p>But now was the hour struck when Rabesqurat could be held no longer
serving the ferry in Aklis; and the terrible Queen streamed in the
sky, like a red disastrous comet, and dived, eagle-like, into the
depths, re- ascending with Shagpat in her arms, cherishing him; and
<span class="lol">lol</span>, there were suddenly a thousand Shagpats multiplied about, and the
hand of Shibli Bagarag became exhausted with hewing at them. The
scornful laugh of the Queen was heard throughout earth as she
triumphed over Shibli Bagarag with hundreds of Shagpats, Illusions;
and he knew not where to strike at the Shagpat, and was losing all
sleight of hand, dexterity, and cunning.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands; Now give some surance
that thou art Revenge,-- Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot
wheels; And then I&#8217;ll come and be thy waggoner, And whirl along with
thee about the globe. Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,
To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away, And find out murderers in
their guilty caves: And when thy car is loaden with their heads I will
dismount, and by the waggon-wheel Trot, like a servile footman, all
day long, Even from Hyperion&#8217;s rising in the east Until his very
downfall in the sea: And day by day I&#8217;ll do this heavy task, So thou
destroy Rapine and Murder there.</p>

<p>7:9 After this I beheld, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a great multitude, which no man
could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues,
stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white
robes, and palms in their hands; 7:10 And cried with a loud voice,
saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb. 7:11 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and
about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on
their faces, and worshipped God, 7:12 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and
glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might,
be unto our God for ever and ever.</p>

<p>Then the king asked where his sons were, and Gudrun answered, &#8220;I will
tell thee, and gladden thine heart by the telling; <span class="lol">lol</span> now, thou didst
make a great woe spring up for me in the slaying of my brethren; now
hearken and hear my rede and my deed; thou hast lost thy sons, and
their heads are become beakers on the board here, and thou thyself
hast drunken the blood of them blended with wine; and their hearts I
took and roasted them on a spit, and thou hast eaten thereof. &#8221; King
Atli answered, &quot;Grim art thou in that thou hast murdered thy sons, and
given me their flesh to eat, and little space passes betwixt ill deed
of thine and ill deed.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies, Here manly Hector faints, here
Troilus swounds; Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies, And
friend to friend gives unadvised wounds, And one man&#8217;s lust these many
lives confounds: Had doting Priam check&#8217;d his son&#8217;s desire, Troy had
been bright with fame and not with fire. &#8217; Here feelingly she weeps
Troy&#8217;s painted woes: For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell, Once set
on ringing, with his own weight goes; Then little strength rings out
the doleful knell: So Lucrece set a-work sad tales doth tell To
pencill&#8217;d pensiveness and colour&#8217;d sorrow; She lends them words, and
she their looks doth borrow.</p>

<p>Then I went driving my goats home speedily, so that the sun was barely
set when I came to the garth; and a great horror rather than a fear of
my mistress was on me; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! she stood in the door of the house
gazing down the garth and the woodland beyond, as though she were
looking for my coming: and when her eyes lighted on me, she scowled,
and drew her lips back from her teeth and clenched her hands with
fury, though there was nought in them; and she was a tall and strong
woman, though now growing somewhat old: but as for me, I had
unsheathed the carline&#8217;s gift before I came to the garth, and now I
held it behind my back in my left hand.</p>

<p>That was all I understood of their discourse, which was very crabbed;
and they took away my dress and gave me other clothes, and I looked
like a Corahani, and away we marched for many days amidst deserts and
small villages, and more than once it seemed to me that I was amongst
the Errate, for their ways were the same: the men would hokkawar
(cheat) with mules and asses, and the women told baji, and after many
days we came before a large town, and the black man said, &#8216;Go in
there, little sister, and there you will find your ro;&#8217; and I went to
the gate, and an armed Corahano stood within the gate, and I looked in
his face, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! it was my ro.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, as the bark that hath discharg&#8217;d her fraught Returns with precious
lading to the bay From whence at first she weigh&#8217;d her anchorage,
Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs, To re-salute his country
with his tears,-- Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.-- Thou
great defender of this Capitol, Stand gracious to the rites that we
intend!-- Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons, Half of the number
that King Priam had, Behold the poor remains, alive and dead! These
that survive let Rome reward with love; These that I bring unto their
latest home, With burial amongst their ancestors; Here Goths have
given me leave to sheathe my sword.</p>

<p>Gudrun answered full of wrath, &#8220;Thou wouldst be wise if thou shouldst
hold thy peace rather than revile my husband: <span class="lol">lol</span> now, the talk of all
men it is, that none has ever abode in this world like unto him in all
matters soever; and little it beseems thee of all folk to mock him who
was thy first beloved: and Fafnir he slew, yea, and he rode thy
flaming fire, whereas thou didst deem that he was Gunnar the King, and
by thy side he lay, and took from thine hand the ring Andvari&#8217;s-loom;
-- here mayst thou well behold it! &#8221; Then Brynhild saw the ring and
knew it, and waxed as wan as a dead woman, and she went home and spake
no word the evening long.</p>

<p>Then she related to her son what had befallen the Kazi and the Wali
from the man and how he had bastinado&#8217;d the police, showing him as he
spoke the blood which had poured from their bodies upon the floor for
excess of flogging; and she continued, &quot;Presently I complained to him
of my case, how the Commander of the Faithful had seized thee and
imprisoned thee when he said to me, &#8216;At this very moment I fare to the
Caliph and cause him to free thy son and suffer him to return home;
also to robe him and to increase his fiefs;&#8217; whereupon he went from us
and after an hour, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! thou appearedst; so but for him we
had never seen thee any more.</p>

which compose the portion of the tongue which moves in the mouth. And
when _a o u_ are spoken with a clear and rapid pronunciation, it is
necessary, in order to pronounce continuously, without any pause
between, that the opening of the lips should close by degrees; that
is, they are wide apart in saying _a_, closer in saying _o_, and much
closer still to pronounce _u_.</p>

<p>Then they set up the gallows and made Ja&#8217;afar and the others stand
underneath in readiness for execution, but whilst every eye was
looking for the Caliph&#8217;s signal, and the crowd wept for Ja&#8217;afar and
his cousins of the Barmecides, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold! a young man fair of face
and neat of dress and of favour like the moon raining light, with eyes
black and bright, and brow flower-white, and cheeks red as rose and
young down where the beard grows, and a mole like a grain of
ambergris, pushed his way through the people till he stood immediately
before the Wazir and said to him, &quot;Safety to thee from this strait, O

<p>Victor made reply: &#8220;Down knelt in Heaven the Angelic Orders Nine, And
all the Prophets and the Apostles knelt, And all the Creatures of the
hand of God Visible, and invisible, down knelt, While thou thy mighty
Mass, though altarless, Offeredst in spirit, and thine Offering
joined; And all God&#8217;s Saints on earth, or roused from sleep Or on the
wayside pausing, knelt, the cause Not knowing; likewise yearned the
Souls to God In that fire-clime benign that clears from sin; And <span class="lol">lol</span>!

<p>Right so betwixt a *titleless tyrant* *usurper* And an outlaw, or else
a thief errant, *wandering The same I say, there is no difference (To
Alexander told was this sentence), But, for the tyrant is of greater
might By force of meinie* for to slay downright, *followers And burn
both house and home, and make all plain,* *level <span class="lol">Lol</span>, therefore is he
call&#8217;d a capitain; And, for the outlaw hath but small meinie, And may
not do so great an harm as he, Nor bring a country to so great

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, now the Trinity appears unto me in a glass darkly, which is Thou
my God, because Thou, O Father, in Him Who is the Beginning of our
wisdom, Which is Thy Wisdom, born of Thyself, equal unto Thee and
coeternal, that is, in Thy Son, createdst heaven and earth. Much now
have we said of the Heaven of heavens, and of the earth invisible and
without form, and of the darksome deep, in reference to the wandering
instability of its spiritual deformity, unless it had been converted
unto Him, from Whom it had its then degree of life, and by His
enlightening became a beauteous life, and the heaven of that heaven,
which was afterwards set between water and water.</p>

<p>Under the cool shade of a sycamore I thought to close mine eyes some
half an hour; When, <span class="lol">lol</span>, to interrupt my purpos&#8217;d rest, Toward that
shade I might behold addrest The king and his companions: warily I
stole into a neighbour thicket by, And overheard what you shall
overhear; That, by and by, disguis&#8217;d they will be here. Their herald
is a pretty knavish page, That well by heart hath conn&#8217;d his
embassage: Action and accent did they teach him there; &#8216;Thus must thou
speak&#8217; and &#8216;thus thy body bear,&#8217; And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out; &#8216;For&#8217; quoth the King &#8217;an angel

<p>Ralph bids him so do, but to heed well that he hurt no man, or let
fire get into any house or roof; so he takes his knot of men and rides
off on the spur, and Ralph and the main of them come on quietly; and
when they came into the street of the thorp, <span class="lol">lol</span> there by the cross a
big fire lighted, and the elders standing thereby cap in hand, and a
score of stout carles with weapons in their hands. Then the chief man
came up to Ralph and greeted him and said: &quot;Lord, when we heard that
an armed company was at hand we deemed no less than that the riders of
the Burg were upon us, and deemed that there was nought for it but to
flee each as far and as fast as he might.</p>

<p>She had forgot how, long enslaved, she yearned To the one helping hand
above; Forgot her faith in the Great Undiscerned, Whereof she sprang
aloft to her Angelical love That day: and he, the bright day&#8217;s
husband, still with love, Though alien, though to an upper seat
retired, Behold a wrangling heart, as &#8217;twere her soul On eddies of
wild waters cast; In wilderness division; fired For domination,
freedom, lust, The Pleasures; <span class="lol">lol</span>, a witch&#8217;s snaky bowl Set at her
lips; the blood-drinker&#8217;s madness fast Upon her; and therewith
mistrust, Most of herself: a mouth of guile. Compassionately could he
smile, To hear the mouth disclaiming God, And clamouring for the Just!</p>

<p>Upon this he sat up through the night in deep thought and, when broke
the dawn and appeared the morn and light was again born, and the Sun
greeted the Good whose beauties the world adorn,[FN#79] he donned his
handsomest dress and going in to King Yunan, he kissed the ground
before him: then he prayed for the endurance of his honour and
prosperity in fairest language and made himself known saying, &quot;O King,
tidings have reached I me of what befel thee through that which is in
thy person; and how the host of physicians have proved themselves
unavailing to abate it; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! I can cure thee, O King; and yet will
I not make thee drink of draught or anoint thee with ointment.</p>

<p>All on a sudden a tremendous peal of thunder struck upon my slumbering
ear; I started up staggering and trembling; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, it seemed as if
the whole hemisphere had burst forth in one flaming sheet of fire, and
mountains, and cities, and forests melted away like wax in the
furnace; and then rose a howling whirlwind, which swept before it the
earth, and the sea, and heaven; then came a sound, as from brazen
trumpets, &#8220;Earth, give up thy dead: sea, give up thy dead! &#8221; and the
open plains began to heave, and to cast up skulls, and ribs, and
jawbones, and legs, which drew together into human bodies, and then
came sweeping along in dense, interminable masses--a living deluge.</p>

<p>18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat
in the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyes
and looked, and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he
ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the
ground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy
sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a little
water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves
under the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort
ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come
to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</p>

<p>With laughter &#8216;gan they hale Down to the sea the keels: but <span class="lol">lol</span>, their
haste Was reined in by Achilles&#8217; mighty son: He assembled them, and
told his sire&#8217;s behest: &quot;Hearken, dear sons of Argives battle-staunch,
To this my glorious father&#8217;s hest, to me Spoken in darkness slumbering
on my bed: He saith, he dwells with the Immortal Gods: He biddeth you
and Atreus&#8217; son the king To bring, as his war-guerdon passing-fair, To
his dim dark tomb Polyxeina queenly-robed, To slay her there, but far
thence bury her. But if ye slight him, and essay to sail The sea, he
threateneth to stir up the waves To bar your path upon the deep, and
here Storm-bound long time to hold you, ships and men.</p>

<p>Many a time for hours, Beside the placid breathings of the King, In
the dead night, grim faces came and went Before her, or a vague
spiritual fear-- Like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors, Heard
by the watcher in a haunted house, That keeps the rust of murder on
the walls-- Held her awake: or if she slept, she dreamed An awful
dream; for then she seemed to stand On some vast plain before a
setting sun, And from the sun there swiftly made at her A ghastly
something, and its shadow flew Before it, till it touched her, and she
turned-- When <span class="lol">lol</span>! her own, that broadening from her feet, And
blackening, swallowed all the land, and in it Far cities burnt, and
with a cry she woke.</p>

<p>Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased To shine on my
contemptible estate: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, whilst I waited on my tender lambs And to
sun&#8217;s parching heat display&#8217;d my cheeks, God&#8217;s mother deigned to
appear to me, And in a vision full of majesty Will&#8217;d me to leave my
base vocation, And free my country from calamity: Her aid she promised
and assured success: In complete glory she reveal&#8217;d herself; And,
whereas I was black and swart before, With those clear rays which she
infused on me That beauty am I bless&#8217;d with which you may see. Ask me
what question thou canst possible, And I will answer unpremeditated:
My courage try by combat, if thou dar&#8217;st, And thou shalt find that I
exceed my sex.</p>

<p>Now, the thought of Noorna, his betrothed, where she rested waiting
for him to deliver her, filled Shibli Bagarag with the extremes of
anguish; and he lifted his right arm and dashed it above his head in
the violence of his grief, striking in the motion a hidden gong that
gave forth a burst of thunder and a roll of bellowings, and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the
door opened before him, and the throne as he sat on it moved out of
the chamber into the hall where he had seen the damsels that duped
him, and on every side of the hall doors opened; and he marvelled to
see men, old and young, beardless and venerable, sitting upon thrones
and crowned with crowns, motionless, with eyes like stones in the
recesses.</p>

<p>10:2 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two
men by Rachel&#8217;s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and
they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are
found: and, <span class="lol">lol</span>, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and
sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? 10:3 Then shalt
thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of
Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel,
one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread,
and another carrying a bottle of wine: 10:4 And they will salute thee,
and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their
hands.</p>

<p>Mucio, like his evil genius, was spiriting away his supplies just as
they were reaching his hands; a threatening tempest seemed rolling up
from France; the whole population of the Provinces which he had
&#8220;reconciled&#8221;--a million of paupers--were crying to him for bread;
great commercial cities, suddenly blasted and converted into dens of
thieves and beggars, were cursing the royal author of their ruin, and
uttering wild threats against his vicegerent; there seemed, in truth,
nothing left for Alexander but to plunge headlong into destruction,
when, <span class="lol">lol</span>! Mr. Comptroller Croft, advancing out of the clouds, like a
propitious divinity, disguised in the garb of a foe--and the scene was
changed.</p>

<p>These voices did I follow through the trees, Threading the coppice
&#8217;neath a starless sky, When, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the very Queen of Goddesses, In
golden beauty gleaming wondrously, Even she that hath the Heaven for
canopy, And in the arms of mighty Zeus doth sleep, - And then for
dread methought that I must die, But Hera called me with soft voice
and deep: L. &quot;&#8217;Paris, give me the prize, and thou shalt reign O&#8217;er
many lordly peoples, far and wide, From them that till the black and
crumbling plain, Where the sweet waters of Aegyptus glide, To those
that on the Northern marches ride, And the Ceteians, and the blameless
men That round the rising-place of Morn abide, And all the dwellers in
the Asian fen.</p>

<p>Now, Baba Mustapha was persuaded by the scimitars of the guard to a
second essay on the head of Shagpat, and the second time he was shot
away from Shagpat through the crowd and great assemblage to the
extreme end of the hall, where he lay writhing about, abandoned in
loathliness; and he in his despondency, and despite of protestation
and the slackness of his limbs, was pricked again by the scimitars of
the guard to a third essay on the head of Shagpat, the people jeering
at him, for they were joyous, light of heart; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! the third time
he was shot off violently, and whirled away like a stone from a sling,
even into the outer air and beyond the city walls, into the distance
of waste places.</p>

<p>By long roads rides Sigurd, till he comes at the last up on to
Hindfell, and wends his way south to the land of the Franks; and he
sees before him on the fell a great light, as of fire burning, and
flaming up even unto the heavens; and when he came thereto, <span class="lol">lol</span>, a
shield hung castle before him, and a banner on the topmost thereof:
into the castle went Sigurd, and saw one lying there asleep, and all-
armed. Therewith he takes the helm from off the head of him, and sees
that it is no man, but a woman; and she was clad in a byrny as closely
set on her as though it had gown to her flesh; so he rent it from the
collar downwards; and then the sleeves thereof, and ever the sword bit
on it as if it were cloth.</p>

<p>And now as Ursula knelt to embrace Ralph with one hand, she held out
the other to the said robin who perched on her wrist, and sat there as
a hooded falcon had done, and fell to whistling his sweet notes, as if
he were a-talking to those new-comers: then Ursula gave him a song-
reward of their broken meat, and he flew up and perched on her
shoulder, and nestled up against her cheek, and she laughed happily
and said: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span> you, sweet, have not the wild things understood my
words, and sent this fair messenger to foretell us all good? &#8221; &#8220;It is
good,&#8221; said Ralph laughing, &quot;yet the oak-tree hath not spoken yet,
despite of all thy kissing: and <span class="lol">lol</span> there goes thy friend the robin,
now thou hast no more meat to give him.</p>

<p>And whan that he so fer was that the soun Of that he speke, no man

<p>But when he came to the oak-tree again, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the knight and the Lady
both kneeling over the body of the Black Knight, and Ralph saw that
the Knight of the Sun was sobbing and weeping sorely, so that he
deemed that he was taking leave of his friend that lay dead there: but
when Ralph had tied up those other two steeds by Silverfax and drawn
rear to those twain, the Knight of the Sun looked up at him, and spake
in a cheerful voice: &#8220;Thou seemest to be no ill man, though thou hast
come across my lady; so now I bid thee rejoice that there is a good
knight more in the world than we deemed e&#8217;en now; for this my friend
Walter the Black is alive still. &#8221; &#8220;Yea,&#8221; said the Lady, &quot;and belike
he shall live a long while yet.</p>

<p>X <span class="lol">Lol</span>, where hurricane flocks of the North-wind rattle their thunder
Loud through a night, and at dawn comes change to the great South-
west, Hounds are the hounded in clouds, waves, forests, inverted the
race: <span class="lol">Lol</span>, in the day&#8217;s young beams the colossal invading pursuers
Burst upon rocks and were foam; Ridged up a torrent crest; Crumbled to
ruin, still gazing a glacial wonder; Turned shamed feet toe to heel on
their track at a panic pace. Yesterday&#8217;s clarion cock scudded hen of
the invalid comb; They, the triumphant tonant towering upper, were
under; They, violators of home, dared hope an inviolate home; They
that had stood for the stroke were the vigorous hewers; Quick as the
trick of the wrist with the rapier, they the pursuers.</p>

<p>But he had in memory prominently now the many glorious pictures of
that mountain-land beckoning to him, waving him to fly forth from the
London oven:--<span class="lol">lol</span>, the Tyrolese limestone crags with livid peaks and
snow lining shelves and veins of the crevices; and folds of pinewood
undulations closed by a shoulder of snow large on the blue; and a
dazzling pinnacle rising over green pasture-Alps, the head of it
shooting aloft as the blown billow, high off a broken ridge, and wide-
armed in its pure white shroud beneath; tranced, but all motion in
immobility, to the heart in the eye; a splendid image of striving, up
to crowned victory. And see the long valley-sweeps of the hanging
meadows and maize, and lower vineyards and central tall green spires!</p>

<p>Then the big man put his fingers to his mouth and whistled again in
answer, a third whistle answered him; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, presently, as their
company hastened on, the voices of men, and anon they came into a
little wood-lawn wherein standing about or lying on the grass beside
their horses were more than a score of men well armed, but without any
banner or token, and all in white armour with white Gaberdines
thereover; and they had with them, as Ralph judged, some dozen of
horses more than they needed for their own riding. Great was the joy
at this meeting, and there was embracing and kissing of friends: but
Ralph noted that no man embraced that slender youth, and that he held
him somewhat aloof from the others, and all seemed to do him
reverence.</p>

<p>The door-handle of my room, which was different to me from all the
other doorhandles in the world, inasmuch as it seemed to open of its
own accord and without my having to turn it, so unconscious had its
manipulation become; <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold, it was now an astral body for
Golo. And as soon as the dinner-bell rang I would run down to the
dining-room, where the big hanging lamp, ignorant of Golo and
Bluebeard but well acquainted with my family and the dish of stewed
beef, shed the same light as on every other evening; and I would fall
into the arms of my mother, whom the misfortunes of Geneviève de
Brabant had made all the dearer to me, just as the crimes of Golo had
driven me to a more than ordinarily scrupulous examination of my own
conscience.</p>

<p>Born from the first blind yearning of the earth To be a mother and
give happy birth, Ere yet the northern sun such rapture brings, <span class="lol">Lol</span>,
from her virgin breast the Snowdrop springs; And ere the snows have
melted from the grass, And not a strip of greensward doth appear, Save
the faint prophecy its cheeks declare, Alone, unkissed, unloved,
behold it pass! While in the ripe enthronement of the year, Whispering
the breeze, and wedding the rich air With her so sweet, delicious
bridal breath, - Odorous and exquisite beyond compare, And starr&#8217;d
with dews upon her forehead clear, Fresh-hearted as a Maiden Queen
should be Who takes the land&#8217;s devotion as her fee, - The Wild Rose
blooms, all summer for her dower, Nature&#8217;s most beautiful and perfect
flower.</p>

<p>So in the caverns of the forest green, Or on the rocks of echoing
ocean hoar, Zonoras and Prince Athanase were seen By summer woodmen;
and when winter&#8217;s roar _185 Sounded o&#8217;er earth and sea its blast of
war, The Balearic fisher, driven from shore, Hanging upon the peaked
wave afar, Then saw their lamp from Laian&#8217;s turret gleam, Piercing the
stormy darkness, like a star _190 Which pours beyond the sea one
steadfast beam, Whilst all the constellations of the sky Seemed
reeling through the storm...They did but seem-- For, <span class="lol">lol</span>! the wintry
clouds are all gone by, And bright Arcturus through yon pines is
glowing, _195 And far o&#8217;er southern waves, immovably Belted Orion
hangs--warm light is flowing From the young moon into the sunset&#8217;s
chasm.-- &#8217;O, summer eve!</p>

field, Where, huddled here and there on mound and knoll, Were men and
women staring and aghast, While some yet fled; and then he plainlier
told How the huge Earl lay slain within his hall. But when the knight
besought him, &#8216;Follow me, Prince, to the camp, and in the King&#8217;s own
ear Speak what has chanced; ye surely have endured Strange chances
here alone;&#8217; that other flushed, And hung his head, and halted in

*spiritually Sawen of faith the magnanimity, And eke the clearness
whole of sapience, And sundry workes bright of excellence. And right
so as these philosophers write, That heav&#8217;n is swift and round, and
eke burning, Right so was faire Cecilie the white Full swift and busy
in every good working, And round and whole in good persevering, &lt;8&gt;
And burning ever in charity full bright; Now have I you declared *what

<p>Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard, and judged,
Without wrath or reviling; we expected Immediate dissolution, which we
thought Was meant by death that day; when <span class="lol">lol</span>!to thee Pains only in
child-bearing were foretold, And bringing forth; soon recompensed with
joy, Fruit of thy womb: On me the curse aslope Glanced on the ground;
with labour I must earn My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse;
My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold Or heat should injure us,
his timely care Hath, unbesought, provided; and his hands Clothed us
unworthy, pitying while he judged; How much more, if we pray him, will
his ear Be open, and his heart to pity incline, And teach us further
by what means to shun The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and
snow!</p>

<p>(79) ASMODEUS When Solomon in his wealth and prosperity grew unmindful
of his God, and, contrary to the injunctions laid down for kings in
the Torah, multiplied wives unto himself, and craved the possession of
many horses and much gold, the Book of Deuteronomy stepped before God
and said: &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, O Lord of the world, Solomon is seeking to remove a Yod
from out of me, (80) for Thou didst write: &#8216;The king shall not
multiply horses unto himself, nor shall he multiply wives to himself,
neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold&#8217;; but
Solomon has acquired many horses, many wives, and much silver and
gold. &#8221; Hereupon God said: &quot;As thou livest, Solomon and a hundred of
his kind shall be annihilated ere a single one of thy letters shall be
obliterated.</p>

<p>13:4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong
drink, and eat not any unclean thing: 13:5 For, <span class="lol">lol</span>, thou shalt
conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the
child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin
to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. 13:6 Then the
woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me,
and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very
terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his
name: 13:7 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear
a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean
thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the
day of his death.</p>

<p>All too soon did ye fall to working wrong against him and against me,
whenas I abode at home with my father, and had all that I would, and
had no will that any one of you should be any of mine, as ye rode into
our garth, ye three kings together; but then Atli led me apart
privily, and asked me if I would not have him who rode Grani; yea, a
man nowise like unto you; but in those days I plighted myself to the
son of King Sigmund and no other; and <span class="lol">lol</span>, now, no better shall ye fare
for the death of me. &quot; Then rose up Gunnar, and laid his arms about
her neck, and besought her to live and have wealth from him; and all
others in likewise letted her from dying; but she thrust them all from
her, and said that it was not the part of any to let her in that which
was her will.</p>

<p>When the Emir Bahram and the Emir Rustam and the Chief Chamberlain,
with the Moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight of
Constantinople they saw that the Nazarenes had mounted the walls and
manned the towers and the forts, and had set all their defenders in
order of defence, as soon as they learned of the approach of the host
of Al-Islam and the banners Mohammedan, and they heard the clash of
arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from
their look outs they beheld the Moslems, with their standards and
ensigns of the Faith of Unity under the dust clouds and <span class="lol">lol</span>! they were
like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain, and the voices
of the Moslems chanting the Koran and glorifying the Compassionate
One, struck their ears.</p>

<p>Now Signy and the king had two children of tender age, who played with
a golden toy on the floor, and bowled it along the pavement of the
hall, running along with it; but therewith a golden ring from off it
trundles away into the place where Sigmund and Sinfjotli lay, and off
runs the little one to search for the same, and beholds withal where
two men axe sitting, big and grimly to look on, with overhanging helms
and bright white byrnies; (2) so he runs up the hall to his father,
and tells him of the sight he has seen, and thereat the king misdoubts
of some guile abiding him; but Signy heard their speech, and arose and
took both the children, and went out into the porch to them and said
-- &quot;<span class="lol">Lol</span> ye! These younglings have bewrayed you; come now therefore and
slay them!</p>

<p>If I were to make an emendation by mere conjecture, I would read
instead of, though the likeness be not so great as in <span class="lol">lol</span>; because that
is the word used by Josephus just before, as has been already noted on
this very occasion, while, an arrow or dart, is only a poetical word,
and never used by Josephus elsewhere, and is indeed no way suitable to
the occasion, this engine not throwing arrows or darts, but great
stones, at this time. (16) Josephus supposes, in this his admirable
speech to the Jews, that not Abraham only, but Pharaoh king of Egypt,
prayed towards a temple at Jerusalem, or towards Jerusalem itself, in
which were Mount Sion and Mount Moriah, on which the tabernacle and
temple did afterwards stand; and this long before either the Jewish
tabernacle or temple were built.</p>

<p>and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no
telling how many times they DIDN&#8217;T steal that; and flour, and candles,

thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and
me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day AND night,
as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair
nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, <span class="lol">lol</span> and
behold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not
only fools US but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets
AWAY with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and
twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time! I tell
you, it just bangs anything I ever HEARD of.</p>

<p>Therewith my father earnestly recommended to Mr. Squills the careful
perusal of certain passages in Thucydides, just previous to the
outbreak of the Peloponnesian war (Squills hastily nodded the most
servile acquiescence), and drew an ingenious parallel between the
signs and symptoms foreboding that outbreak and the very apprehension
of coming war which was evinced by the recent <span class="lol">lol</span> pawns to peace. (2)
And after sundry notable and shrewd remarks, tending to show where
elements for war were already ripening, amidst clashing opinions and
disorganized states, he wound up with saying: &quot;So that, all things
considered, I think we had better just keep up enough of the bellicose
spirit not to think it a sin if we are called upon to fight for our
pestles and mortars, our three- percents, goods, chattels, and
liberties.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, Moses forty days and forty night Fasted, ere that the high God

Horeb, ere he had any speech With highe God, that is our live&#8217;s

<p>At length a reverend sire among them came, And of their doings great
dislike declared, And testified against their ways; he oft Frequented
their assemblies, whereso met, Triumphs or festivals; and to them
preached Conversion and repentance, as to souls In prison, under
judgements imminent: But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased
Contending, and removed his tents far off; Then, from the mountain
hewing timber tall, Began to build a vessel of huge bulk; Measured by
cubit, length, and breadth, and highth; Smeared round with pitch; and
in the side a door Contrived; and of provisions laid in large, For man
and beast: when <span class="lol">lol</span>, a wonder strange! Of every beast, and bird, and
insect small, Came sevens, and pairs; and entered in as taught Their
order: last the sire and his three sons, With their four wives; and
God made fast the door.</p>

<p>and even as he spoke Fell into dust, and disappeared, and I Was left
alone once more, and cried in grief, &#8220;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, if I find the Holy Grail
itself And touch it, it will crumble into dust. &#8221; &#8216;And thence I dropt
into a lowly vale, Low as the hill was high, and where the vale Was
lowest, found a chapel, and thereby A holy hermit in a hermitage, To
whom I told my phantoms, and he said: &#8217;&quot;O son, thou hast not true
humility, The highest virtue, mother of them all; For when the Lord of
all things made Himself Naked of glory for His mortal change, &#8216;Take
thou my robe,&#8217; she said, &#8216;for all is thine,&#8217; And all her form shone
forth with sudden light So that the angels were amazed, and she
Followed Him down, and like a flying star Led on the gray-haired
wisdom of the east; But her thou hast not known: for what is this Thou
thoughtest of thy prowess and thy sins?</p>

<p>And now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner
to a satisfactory end, <span class="lol">lol</span> and behold the page who had carried the
letters and presents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho,
entered the hall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to
see him, being anxious to know the result of his journey; but when
they asked him the page said in reply that he could not give it before
so many people or in a few words, and begged their excellences to be
pleased to let it wait for a private opportunity, and in the meantime
amuse themselves with these letters; and taking out the letters he
placed them in the duchess&#8217;s hand. One bore by way of address, Letter
for my lady the Duchess So-and-so, of I don&#8217;t know where; and the
other To my husband Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria,
whom God prosper longer than me.</p>

<p>18:14 Now, <span class="lol">lol</span>, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father&#8217;s sins
which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 18:15
That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his
eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his
neighbour&#8217;s wife, 18:16 Neither hath oppressed any, hath not
withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath
given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a
garment, 18:17 That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath
not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath
walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his
father, he shall surely live. 18:18 As for his father, because he
cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which
is not good among his people, <span class="lol">lol</span>, even he shall die in his iniquity.</p>

<p>And the king of the Moors was not at that time in Fez, but was absent
in his wars; and I arose and followed him, even unto Arbat, which is a
seaport, and when I arrived there, <span class="lol">lol</span>! I found him not, but his son
was there, and men said unto me that to speak unto the son was to
speak unto the king, even Muley Abderrahman; so I went in unto the
king&#8217;s son, and I kneeled before him, and I lifted up my voice and I
said unto him what I had to say, and he looked courteously upon me and
said, &#8217;Truly thy tale is a sorrowful one, and it maketh me sad; and
what thou asketh, that will I grant, and thy father&#8217;s death shall be
avenged and the spoilers shall be despoiled; and I will write thee a
letter with my own hand unto the Pasha, even the Pasha of Tafilaltz,
and I will enjoin him to make inquiry into thy matter, and that letter
thou shalt thyself carry and deliver unto him.</p>

<p>And Arthur came, and labouring up the pass, All in a misty moonshine,
unawares Had trodden that crowned skeleton, and the skull Brake from
the nape, and from the skull the crown Rolled into light, and turning
on its rims Fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn: And down the
shingly scaur he plunged, and caught, And set it on his head, and in
his heart Heard murmurs, &#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, thou likewise shalt be King. &#8217;
Thereafter, when a King, he had the gems Plucked from the crown, and
showed them to his knights, Saying, &#8216;These jewels, whereupon I chanced
Divinely, are the kingdom&#8217;s, not the King&#8217;s-- For public use:
henceforward let there be, Once every year, a joust for one of these:
For so by nine years&#8217; proof we needs must learn Which is our
mightiest, and ourselves shall grow In use of arms and manhood, till
we drive The heathen, who, some say, shall rule the land Hereafter,
which God hinder.</p>

<p>And waving his dusty beaver hat, He cheered across the chase-filled
water, And clapt his arm about his daughter, And gave to Joan a
courteous hug, And kiss that, like a stubborn plug From generous vats
in vastness rounded, The inner wealth and spirit sounded: Eagerly
pointing South, where, <span class="lol">lol</span>, The daintiest, fleetest-footed doe Led o&#8217;er
the fields and thro&#8217; the furze Beyond: her lively delicate ears Prickt
up erect, and in her track A dappled lengthy-striding pack. Scarce had
they cast eyes upon her, When every heart was wagered on her, And half
in dread, and half delight, They watched her lovely bounding flight;
As now across the flashing green, And now beneath the stately trees,
And now far distant in the dene, She headed on with graceful ease:
Hanging aloft with doubled knees, At times athwart some hedge or gate;
And slackening pace by slow degrees, As for the foremost foe to wait.</p>

<p>Even in the terror of the combat, Shibli Bagarag was fair to burst
into a fit of violent laughter at the sight of the Queen wagging her
neck loosely, perking it like a mad raven; and he took heart, and
swept the blade rapidly over Shagpat as she dandled him, leaving
Shagpat but one hair remaining on him; yet was that the Identical; and
it arose, and was a serpent in his head, and from its jaws issued a
river of fiery serpents: these and a host of Afrites besieged Shibli
Bagarag; and now, to defend himself, he unloosed the twin Genii,
Karavejis and Veejravoosh, from the wrist of that hand which wielded
the Sword of Aklis, and these alternately interwound before and about
him, and were even as a glittering armour of emerald plates, warding
from him the assaults of the host; and <span class="lol">lol</span>! he flew, and the battle
followed him over blazing cities and lands on fire with the slanting
hail of sparkles.</p>

<p>But at the approach of the Easter holidays, when my parents bad
promised to let me spend them, for once, in the North of Italy, <span class="lol">lol</span>! in
place of those dreams of tempests, by which I had been entirely
possessed, not wishing to see anything but waves dashing in from all
sides, mounting always higher, upon the wildest of coasts, beside
churches as rugged and precipitous as cliffs, in whose towers the sea-
birds would be wailing; suddenly, effacing them, taking away all their
charm, excluding them because they were its opposite and could only
have weakened its effect, was substituted in me the converse dream of
the most variegated of springs, not the spring of Combray, still
pricking with all the needle-points of the winter&#8217;s frost, but that
which already covered with lilies and anemones the meadows of Fiesole,
and gave Florence a dazzling golden background, like those in Fra
Angelico&#8217;s pictures.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, in this right hand, whose protection Is most divinely vow&#8217;d upon
the right Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet, Son to the elder
brother of this man, And king o&#8217;er him and all that he enjoys: For
this down-trodden equity we tread In war-like march these greens
before your town; Being no further enemy to you Than the constraint of
hospitable zeal In the relief of this oppressed child Religiously
provokes. Be pleased then To pay that duty which you truly owe To him
that owes it, namely, this young prince: And then our arms, like to a
muzzled bear, Save in aspect, hath all offence seal&#8217;d up; Our cannons&#8217;
malice vainly shall be spent Against the invulnerable clouds of
heaven; And with a blessed and unvex&#8217;d retire, With unhack&#8217;d swords
and helmets all unbruis&#8217;d, We will bear home that lusty blood again
Which here we came to spout against your town, And leave your
children, wives, and you, in peace.</p>

<p>And therefore I you put in this degree, That each of you shall have
his destiny As *him is shape*; and hearken in what wise *as is decreed
for him* <span class="lol">Lol</span> hear your end of that I shall devise. My will is this, for
plain conclusion Withouten any replication*, *reply If that you
liketh, take it for the best, That evereach of you shall go where *him

weekes, *farre ne nerre*, *neither more nor less* Evereach of you
shall bring an hundred knights, Armed for listes up at alle rights All
ready to darraine* her by bataille, *contend for And this behete* I
you withoute fail *promise Upon my troth, and as I am a knight, That
whether of you bothe that hath might, That is to say, that whether he
or thou May with his hundred, as I spake of now, Slay his contrary, or
out of listes drive, Him shall I given Emily to wive, To whom that
fortune gives so fair a grace.</p>

<p>Not to look on those eyes, Those lips, and that hair,--all the smiling
disguise Thou yet wearest, sweet Spirit, which I, day by day, Have so
long called my child, but which now fades away Like a rainbow, and I
the fallen shower?&#8217;--<span class="lol">Lol</span>! the ship _90 Is settling, it topples, the
leeward ports dip; The tigers leap up when they feel the slow brine
Crawling inch by inch on them; hair, ears, limbs, and eyne, Stand
rigid with horror; a loud, long, hoarse cry Bursts at once from their
vitals tremendously, _95 And &#8217;tis borne down the mountainous vale of
the wave, Rebounding, like thunder, from crag to cave, Mixed with the
clash of the lashing rain, Hurried on by the might of the hurricane:
The hurricane came from the west, and passed on _100 By the path of
the gate of the eastern sun, Transversely dividing the stream of the
storm; As an arrowy serpent, pursuing the form Of an elephant, bursts
through the brakes of the waste.</p>

<p>She ceased.--&#8216;<span class="lol">Lol</span>, where red morning thro&#8217; the woods _1240 Is burning
o&#8217;er the dew;&#8217; said Rosalind. And with these words they rose, and
towards the flood Of the blue lake, beneath the leaves now wind With
equal steps and fingers intertwined: Thence to a lonely dwelling,
where the shore _1245 Is shadowed with steep rocks, and cypresses
Cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies, And with their
shadows the clear depths below, And where a little terrace from its
bowers, Of blooming myrtle and faint lemon-flowers, _1250 Scatters its
sense-dissolving fragrance o&#8217;er The liquid marble of the windless
lake; And where the aged forest&#8217;s limbs look hoar, Under the leaves
which their green garments make, They come: &#8217;Tis Helen&#8217;s home, and
clean and white, _1255 Like one which tyrants spare on our own land In
some such solitude, its casements bright Shone through their vine-
leaves in the morning sun, And even within &#8217;twas scarce like Italy.</p>

<p>One by one they passed through the wicket of the gate: which gate
itself was verily huge beyond measure, all built of great ashlar-
stones; and when they were within, it was like a hall somewhat long
and exceeding high, most fairly vaulted; midmost of the said hall they
rode through a noble arch on their right hand, and <span class="lol">lol</span> another hall
exceeding long, but lower than the first, with many glazen windows set
in its townward wall; and when they looked through these, they saw the
river running underneath; for this was naught but the lower bridge of
the city and they learned afterwards and saw, that above the vault of
this long bridge rose up the castle, chamber on chamber, till its
battlements were level with the highest towers of the wall on the hill
top. Thus they passed the bridge, and turning to the left at its
ending, came into the Water-Street of Goldburg, where the river, with
wide quays on either side thereof, ran betwixt the houses.</p>

<p>Their many and notable good havens,&#8220; he said, &#8221;the great number of
ships and mariners, their impregnable towns, if they were in the hands
of a potent prince that would defend them, and, lastly, the state of
this shore; so near and opposite unto the land and coast of England--
<span class="lol">lol</span>, the sight of all this, daily in mine eye, conjoined with the deep,
enrooted malice of that your so mighty enemy who seeketh to regain
them; these things entering continually into the, meditations of my
heart--so much do they import the safety of yourself and your estate--
do enforce me, in the abundance of my love and duty to your Majesty,
most earnestly to speak, write, and weep unto you, lest when the
occasion yet offered shall be gone by, this blessed means of your
defence, by God&#8217;s provident goodness thus put into your hand, will
then be utterly lost, <span class="lol">lol</span>; never, never more to be recovered again. &quot;
It was a noble, wise, and eloquent appeal, but it was muttered in
vain.</p>

<p>_205 <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the sun floats up the sky Like thought-winged Liberty, Till
the universal light Seems to level plain and height; From the sea a
mist has spread, _210 And the beams of morn lie dead On the towers of
Venice now, Like its glory long ago. By the skirts of that gray cloud
Many-domed Padua proud _215 Stands, a peopled solitude, &#8217;Mid the
harvest-shining plain, Where the peasant heaps his grain In the garner
of his foe, And the milk-white oxen slow _220 With the purple vintage
strain, Heaped upon the creaking wain, That the brutal Celt may swill
Drunken sleep with savage will; And the sickle to the sword _225 Lies
unchanged, though many a lord, Like a weed whose shade is poison,
Overgrows this region&#8217;s foison, Sheaves of whom are ripe to come To
destruction&#8217;s harvest-home: _230 Men must reap the things they sow,
Force from force must ever flow, Or worse; but &#8217;tis a bitter woe That
love or reason cannot change The despot&#8217;s rage, the slave&#8217;s revenge.</p>

<p>CXLIII <span class="lol">Lol</span>, as a careful housewife runs to catch One of her feather&#8217;d
creatures broke away, Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay; Whilst her neglected
child holds her in chase, Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face, Not prizing her poor
infant&#8217;s discontent; So runn&#8217;st thou after that which flies from thee,
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind; But if thou catch thy hope,
turn back to me, And play the mother&#8217;s part, kiss me, be kind; So will
I pray that thou mayst have thy &#8216;Will,&#8217; If thou turn back and my loud
crying still. CXLIV Two loves I have of comfort and despair, Which
like two spirits do suggest me still: The better angel is a man right
fair, The worser spirit a woman colour&#8217;d ill. To win me soon to hell,
my female evil, Tempteth my better angel from my side, And would
corrupt my saint to be a devil, Wooing his purity with her foul pride.</p>

<p>So he embraced her and she embraced him, and he kissed her and she
kissed him; then they lay down on the bed of pleasure voluptuous,
repeating the words of the poet, &quot;When his softly bending shape bid
him close to my embrace * Which clips him all about like the tendrils
of the vine And shed a flood of softness on the hardness of his heart,
* He yielded though at first he was minded to decline; And dreading
lest the railer&#8217;s eye should light upon his form, * Came armoured with
caution to baffle his design: His waist makes moan of hinder cheeks
that weigh upon his feet * Like heavy load of merchandise upon young
camel li&#8217;en; Girt with his glances scymitar which seemed athirst for
blood, * And clad in mail of dusky curls that show the sheeniest
shine, His fragrance wafted happy news of footstep coming nigh, * And
to him like a bird uncaged I flew in straightest line: I spread my
cheek upon his path, beneath his sandal-shoon, * And <span class="lol">lol</span>! the
stibium[FN#350] of their dust healed all my hurt of eyne.</p>

<p>To the said woman I sought to-day in the morning, not to win any
wisdom of her, but to talk over remembrances of old days; but when I
came into her house, <span class="lol">lol</span>, there was my carline walking up and down the
floor, and she turned round upon me like the young woman of past days,
and stamped her foot and cried out: &#8216;What does the sluggard dallying
about women&#8217;s chambers when the time is come for the deliverance? &#8217; &#8220;I
let her talk, and spake no word lest I should spoil her story, and she
went on: &#8221;&#8217;Take thy staff, lad, for thou art stout as well as merry,
and go adown to the thorps at the feet of the downs toward Higham;
keep thee well from the Burg-devils, and go from stead to stead till
thou comest on a captain of men-at-arms who is lord over a company of
green-coats, green-coats of the Dry Tree--a young lord, fair-faced,
and kind-faced, and mighty, and not to be conquered, and the blessing
of the folk and the leader of the Shepherds, and the foe of their
foeman and the well-beloved of Bear-father.</p>

<p>this mountain was to view the river below, the weather being So

<p>And all shall be revealed: now list my tale:-- &#8217;Tis five months flown,
--my father yet controlled The land, and bowed our necks with iron
sway; Little I knew but the wild joys of arms, And mimic warfare of
the chase;-- One day,-- Long had we tracked the boar with zealous toil
On yonder woody ridge:--it chanced, pursuing A snow-white hind, far
from your train I roved Amid the forest maze;--the timid beast, Along
the windings of the narrow vale, Through rocky cleft and thick-
entangled brake, Flew onward, scarce a moment lost, nor distant Beyond
a javelin&#8217;s throw; nearer I came not, Nor took an aim; when through a
garden&#8217;s gate, Sudden she vanished:--from my horse quick springing, I
followed:--<span class="lol">lol</span>! the poor scared creature lay Stretched at the feet of a
young, beauteous nun, That strove with fond caress of her fair hands
To still its throbbing heart: wondering, I gazed; And motionless--my
spear, in act to strike, High poised--while she, with her large
piteous eyes For mercy sued--and thus we stood in silence Regarding
one another.</p>

<p>sings the old minnesinger; &#8217;who that has not loved, hearing thee is
touched with the wand of love&#8217;s mysteries, and yearneth to he knoweth
not whom, humbled by overfulness of heart; but who, listening, already
loveth, heareth the language he would speak, yet faileth in; feeleth
the great tongueless sea of his infinite desires stirred beyond his
narrow bosom; is as one stript of wings whom the angels beckon to
their silver homes: and he leaneth forward to ascend to them, and is
mocked by his effort: then is he of the fallen, and of the fallen
would he remain, but that tears lighten him, and through the tears
stream jewelled shafts dropt down to him from the sky, precious
ladders inlaid with amethyst, sapphire, blended jasper, beryl, rose-
ruby, ether of heaven flushed with softened bloom of the insufferable
Presences: and <span class="lol">lol</span>, the ladders dance, and quiver, and waylay his
eyelids, and a second time he is mocked, aspiring: and after the third
swoon standeth Hope before him with folded arms, and eyes dry of the
delusions of tears, saying, Thou hast seen! thou hast felt!</p>

<p>Such was the case with the King and his Wazir, Ibn Shimas, in the
ordinance of his kingdom through his Emirs and Governors; but as
regards the favourite women, wives, concubines and others who, by
their malice and perfidy, had brought about the slaughter of the
Wazirs and had well nigh ruined the realm, as soon as the Court was
dissolved and all the people had departed, each to his own place,
after their affairs had been set in order, the King summoned his boy-
Minister, the son of Shimas, and the other six Wazirs and taking them
apart privily, said to them, &quot;Know, O Wazirs that I have been a
wanderer from the right way, drowned in ignorance, opposed to
admonition, a breaker of facts and promises and a gainsayer of good
counsellors; and the cause of all this was my being fooled by these
women and the wiles whereby they beset me and the glozing lure of
their speech, whereby they seduced me to sin and my acceptance of
this, for that I deemed the words of them true and loyal counsel, by
reason of their sweetness and softness; but <span class="lol">lol</span>, and behold! they were
deadly poison.</p>

<p>But one day at table with the duke and duchess, just as he was about
to carry his resolution into effect and ask for their permission, <span class="lol">lol</span>
and behold suddenly there came in through the door of the great hall
two women, as they afterwards proved to be, draped in mourning from
head to foot, one of whom approaching Don Quixote flung herself at
full length at his feet, pressing her lips to them, and uttering moans
so sad, so deep, and so doleful that she put all who heard and saw her
into a state of perplexity; and though the duke and duchess supposed
it must be some joke their servants were playing off upon Don Quixote,
still the earnest way the woman sighed and moaned and wept puzzled
them and made them feel uncertain, until Don Quixote, touched with
compassion, raised her up and made her unveil herself and remove the
mantle from her tearful face. She complied and disclosed what no one
could have ever anticipated, for she disclosed the countenance of Dona
Rodriguez, the duenna of the house; the other female in mourning being
her daughter, who had been made a fool of by the rich farmer&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>But as the war Waged bitterly for votes and rumors flew About the
bank, and of the heavy loans Which Rhodes, son had made to prop his
loss In wheat, and many drew their coin and left The bank of Rhodes
more hollow, with the talk Among the liberals of another bank Soon to
be chartered, <span class="lol">lol</span>, the bubble burst &#8217;Mid cries and curses; but the
liberals laughed And in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held Wise converse
and inspiriting debate. High on a stage that overlooked the chairs
Where dozens sat, and where a pop--eyed daub Of Shakespeare, very like
the hired man Of Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard, Upon a
drab proscenium outward stared, Sat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,
By merit raised in ribaldry and guile, And to the assembled rebels
thus he spake: &quot;Whether to lie supine and let a clique Cold-blooded,
scheming, hungry, singing psalms, Devour our substance, wreck our
banks and drain Our little hoards for hazards on the price Of wheat or
pork, or yet to cower beneath The shadow of a spire upreared to curb A
breed of lackeys and to serve the bank Coadjutor in greed, that is the
question.</p>

<p>SOUTH-WEST WIND IN THE WOODLAND The silence of preluded song - AEolian
silence charms the woods; Each tree a harp, whose foliaged strings Are
waiting for the master&#8217;s touch To sweep them into storms of joy,
Stands mute and whispers not; the birds Brood dumb in their foreboding
nests, Save here and there a chirp or tweet, That utters fear or
anxious love, Or when the ouzel sends a swift Half warble, shrinking
back again His golden bill, or when aloud The storm-cock warns the
dusking hills And villages and valleys round: For <span class="lol">lol</span>, beneath those
ragged clouds That skirt the opening west, a stream Of yellow light
and windy flame Spreads lengthening southward, and the sky Begins to
gloom, and o&#8217;er the ground A moan of coming blasts creeps low And
rustles in the crisping grass; Till suddenly with mighty arms
Outspread, that reach the horizon round, The great South-West drives
o&#8217;er the earth, And loosens all his roaring robes Behind him, over
heath and moor. He comes upon the neck of night, Like one that leaps a
fiery steed Whose keen black haunches quivering shine With eagerness
and haste, that needs No spur to make the dark leagues fly!</p>

<p>thy lips enkindle : Lift not the painted veil which those who live :
Like the ghost of a dear friend dead : Listen, listen, Mary mine : <span class="lol">Lol</span>,
Peter in Hell&#8217;s Grosvenor Square : Madonna, wherefore hast thou sent
to me : Maiden, quench the glare of sorrow : Many a green isle needs
must be : Melodious Arethusa, o&#8217;er my verse : Men of England,
wherefore plough : Methought I was a billow in the crowd : Mighty
eagle! thou that soarest : Mine eyes were dim with tears unshed :
Monarch of Gods and Daemons, and all Spirits : Month after month the
gathered rains descend : Moonbeam, leave the shadowy vale : Muse, sing
the deeds of golden Aphrodite : Music, when soft voices die : My
coursers are fed with the lightning : My dearest Mary, wherefore hast
thou gone : My faint spirit was sitting in the light : My head is
heavy, my limbs are weary : My head is wild with weeping for a grief :
My lost William, thou in whom : My Song, I fear that thou wilt find
but few : My soul is an enchanted boat : My spirit like a charmed bark
doth swim : My thoughts arise and fade in solitude : My wings are
folded o&#8217;er mine ears : Night, with all thine eyes look down!</p>

<p>And now none might know for what cause Brynhild must bewail with
weeping for what she had prayed for with laughter: but she spake --
&quot;Such a dream I had, Gunnar, as that my bed was acold, and that thou
didst ride into the hands of thy foes: <span class="lol">lol</span> now, ill shall it go with
thee and all thy kin, O ye breakers of oaths; for on the day thou
slayedst him, dimly didst thou remember how thou didst blend thy blood
with the blood of Sigurd, and with an ill reward hast thou rewarded
him for all that he did well to thee; whereas he gave unto thee to be
the mightiest of men; and well was it proven how fast he held to his
oath sworn, when he came to me and laid betwixt us the sharp-edged
sword that in venom had been made hard. All too soon did ye fall to
working wrong against him and against me, whenas I abode at home with
my father, and had all that I would, and had no will that any one of
you should be any of mine, as ye rode into our garth, ye three kings
together; but then Atli led me apart privily, and asked me if I would
not have him who rode Grani; yea, a man nowise like unto you; but in
those days I plighted myself to the son of King Sigmund and no other;
and <span class="lol">lol</span>, now, no better shall ye fare for the death of me.</p>

<p>A wonder Lady: <span class="lol">lol</span> vpon thy wish Our Messenger Chattilion is arriu&#8217;d,
What England saies, say breefely gentle Lord, We coldly pause for
thee, Chatilion speake, Chat. Then turne your forces from this paltry
siege, And stirre them vp against a mightier taske: England impatient
of your iust demands, Hath put himselfe in Armes, the aduerse windes
Whose leisure I haue staid, haue giuen him time To land his Legions
all as soone as I: His marches are expedient to this towne, His forces
strong, his Souldiers confident: With him along is come the Mother
Queene, An Ace stirring him to bloud and strife, With her her Neece,
the Lady Blanch of Spaine, With them a Bastard of the Kings deceast,
And all th&#8217; vnsetled humors of the Land, Rash, inconsiderate, fiery
voluntaries, With Ladies faces, and fierce Dragons spleenes, Haue sold
their fortunes at their natiue homes, Bearing their birth-rights
proudly on their backs, To make a hazard of new fortunes heere: In
briefe, a brauer choyse of dauntlesse spirits Then now the English
bottomes haue waft o&#8217;re, Did neuer flote vpon the swelling tide, To
doe offence and scathe in Christendome: The interruption of their
churlish drums Cuts off more circumstance, they are at hand, Drum
beats.</p>

<p><span class="lol">Lol</span>, Cato, which that was so wise a man, Said he not thus, *&#8216;Ne do no

&#8221;when we fly from these beams, For Godde&#8217;s love, as take some
laxatife; On peril of my soul, and of my life, I counsel you the best,
I will not lie, That both of choler, and melancholy, Ye purge you;
and, for ye shall not tarry, Though in this town is no apothecary, I
shall myself two herbes teache you, That shall be for your health, and
for your prow;* *profit And in our yard the herbes shall I find, The
which have of their property by kind* *nature To purge you beneath,
and eke above. Sire, forget not this for Godde&#8217;s love; Ye be full
choleric of complexion; Ware that the sun, in his ascension, You finde
not replete of humours hot; And if it do, I dare well lay a groat,
That ye shall have a fever tertiane, Or else an ague, that may be your
bane, A day or two ye shall have digestives Of wormes, ere ye take
your laxatives, Of laurel, centaury, &lt;9&gt; and fumeterere, &lt;10&gt; Or else
of elder-berry, that groweth there, Of catapuce, &lt;11&gt; or of the
gaitre-berries, &lt;12&gt; Or herb ivy growing in our yard, that merry is:
Pick them right as they grow, and eat them in, Be merry, husband, for
your father&#8217;s kin; Dreade no dream; I can say you no more.</p>

<p>Then the reckless Lemminkainen Raised his pearl-enamelled birch-rod,
Snapped his whip above his racer, And the steed flew onward swiftly,
Galloped on his distant journey O&#8217;er the highway to Pohyola; Galloped
fast and galloped faster, Galloped on a greater distance, When the
stallion loudly neighing, Stopped and trembled on the highway, Then
the lively Lemminkainen Raised himself upon the cross-bench, Looked to
see what else had happened; <span class="lol">Lol</span> I a wolf stands at the portals, in the
passage-way a black-bear, At the high-gate of Pohyola, At the ending
of the journey. Thereupon young Lemminkainen, Handsome hero,
Kaukomieli, Thrusts his fingers in his pockets, Seeks his magic pouch
of leather, Pulls therefrom a lock of ewe-wool, Rubs it firmly in his
fingers, In his hands it falls to powder; Breathes the breath of life
upon it, When a flock of sheep arises, Goats and sheep of sable color;
On the flock the black-wolf pounces, And the wild-bear aids the
slaughter, While the reckless Lemminkainen Rushes by them on his
journey; Gallops on a little distance, To the court of Sariola, Finds
the fence of molten iron, And of steel the rods and pickets, In the
earth a hundred fathoms, To the azure sky, a thousand, Double-pointed
spears projecting; On each spear were serpents twisted, Adders coiled
in countless numbers, Lizards mingled with the serpents, Tails
entangled pointing earthward, While their heads were skyward whirling,
Writhing, hissing mass of evil.</p>

<p>Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek In Golgotha him dead,
who lives in Heaven; And they, who to be sure of Paradise, Dying, put
on the weeds of Dominick, Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;
They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed, And that crystalling
sphere whose balance weighs The trepidation talked, and that first
moved; And now Saint Peter at Heaven&#8217;s wicket seems To wait them with
his keys, and now at foot Of Heaven&#8217;s ascent they lift their feet,
when <span class="lol">lol</span> A violent cross wind from either coast Blows them transverse,
ten thousand leagues awry Into the devious air: Then might ye see
Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost And fluttered into
rags; then reliques, beads, Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls,
The sport of winds: All these, upwhirled aloft, Fly o&#8217;er the backside
of the world far off Into a Limbo large and broad, since called The
Paradise of Fools, to few unknown Long after; now unpeopled, and
untrod. All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed, And long he
wandered, till at last a gleam Of dawning light turned thither-ward in
haste His travelled steps: far distant he descries Ascending by
degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high; At top
whereof, but far more rich, appeared The work as of a kingly palace-
gate, With frontispiece of diamond and gold Embellished; thick with
sparkling orient gems The portal shone, inimitable on earth By model,
or by shading pencil, drawn.</p>

<p>It was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily
regularity of a clean shirt,--to dismiss his barber unshaven,--and to
allow his surgeon scarce time sufficient to dress his wound,
concerning himself so little about it, as not to ask him once in seven
times dressing, how it went on: when, <span class="lol">lol</span>!--all of a sudden, for the
change was quick as lightning, he began to sigh heavily for his
recovery,--complained to my father, grew impatient with the
surgeon:--and one morning, as he heard his foot coming up stairs, he
shut up his books, and thrust aside his instruments, in order to
expostulate with him upon the protraction of the cure, which, he told
him, might surely have been accomplished at least by that time:--He
dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone, and the sorrows of his
four years melancholy imprisonment;--adding, that had it not been for
the kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of brothers,-- he
had long since sunk under his misfortunes.--My father was by. My uncle
Toby&#8217;s eloquence brought tears into his eyes;--&#8217;twas unexpected:--My
uncle Toby, by nature was not eloquent;--it had the greater
effect:--The surgeon was confounded;--not that there wanted grounds
for such, or greater marks of impatience,--but &#8217;twas unexpected too;
in the four years he had attended him, he had never seen any thing
like it in my uncle Toby&#8217;s carriage; he had never once dropped one
fretful or discontented word;--he had been all patience,--all
submission.</p>

<p>Yea, at that time he led me apart, and asked me which I had chosen of
those who were come; but I prayed him that I might abide to ward the
land and be chief over the third part of his men; then were there two
choices for me to deal betwixt either that I should be wedded to him
whom he would, or lose all my weal and friendship at his hands; and he
said withal that his friendship would be better to me than his wrath:
then I bethought me whether I should yield to his will, or slay many a
man; and therewithal I deemed that it would avail little to strive
with him, and so it fell out, that I promised to wed whomsoever should
ride the horse Grani with Fafnir&#8217;s Hoard, and ride through my flaming
fire, and slay those men whom I called on him to slay, and now so it
was, that none durst ride, save Sigurd only, because he lacked no
heart thereto; yea, and the Worm he flew, and Regin, and five kings
beside; but thou, Gunnar, durst do naught; as pale as a dead man didst
thou wax, and no king thou art, and no champion; so whereas I made a
vow unto my father, that him alone would I love who was the noblest
man alive, and that this is none save Sigurd, <span class="lol">lol</span>, now have I broken my
oath and brought it to naught, since he is none of mine, and for this
cause shall I compass thy death; and a great reward of evil things
have I wherewith to reward Grimhild; -- never, I wot, has woman lived
eviler or of lesser heart than she. &#8220; Gunnar answered in such wise
that few might hear him, &#8221;Many a vile word hast thou spoken, and an
evil-hearted woman art thou, whereas thou revilest a woman far better
than thou; never would she curse her life as thou dost; nay, nor has
she tormented dead folk, or murdered any; but lives her life well
praised of all.</p>

<p>When Nur al-Din heard the girl sing these lines he looked on her with
eyes of love and could scarce contain himself for the violence of his
inclination to her; and on like wise was it with her, because she
glanced at the company who were present of the sons of the merchants
and she saw that Nur al-Din was amongst the rest as moon among stars;
for that he was sweet of speech and replete with amorous grace,
perfect in stature and symmetry, brightness and loveliness, pure of
all defect, than the breeze of morn softer, than Tasnim blander, as
saith of him the poet,[FN#433] &quot;By his cheeks&#8217; unfading damask and his
smiling teeth I swear, By the arros that he feathers with the witchery
of his air, By his sides so soft and tender and his glances bright and
keen, By the whiteness of his forehead and the blackness of his hair,
By his arched imperious eyebrows, chasing slumber from my lids With
their yeas and noes that hold me &#8216;twixt rejoicing and despair, By the
Scorpions that he launches from his ringlet-clustered brows, Seeking
still to slay his lovers with his rigours unaware, By the myrtle of
his whiskers and the roses of his cheek, By his lips&#8217; incarnate rubies
and his teeth&#8217;s fine pearls and rare, By the straight and tender
sapling of his shape, which for its fruit Doth the twin pomegranates,
shining in his snowy bosom, wear, By his heavy hips that tremble, both
in motion and repose, And the slender waist above them, all too slight
their weight to bear, By the silk of his apparel and his quick and
sprightly wit, By all attributes of beauty that are fallen to his
share; <span class="lol">Lol</span>, the musk exhales its fragrance from his breath, and eke the
breeze From his scent the perfume borrows, that it scatters
everywhere. Yea, the sun in all his splendour cannot with his
brightness vie And the crescent moon&#8217;s a fragment that he from his
nails doth pare.</p>

<p>The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,

brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated
by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous

a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy
which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the
Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom
and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had
(effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the
constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen
Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after
the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other
constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other
persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from
immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow,
taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular
animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial
waters, pallor of human beings. His (Bloom&#8217;s) logical conclusion,
